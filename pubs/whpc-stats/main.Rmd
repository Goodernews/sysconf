title: "Representation of Women in High-Performance Computing Conferences"
abstract: |
  Women are severely underrepresented in the HPC workforce. Addressing this large gap requires accurate metrics and information on the representation of women and its associated factors. The goal of this paper is to provide current, broad, and reproducible data on this gender gap. Specifically, this study aims to provide in-depth statistics on women's representation in HPC conferences, focusing mainly on authors of peer-reviewed papers, who serve as the keystone for future advances in the field.

  To this end, we analyzed participant data from nine HPC and HPC-related peer-reviewed conferences. In addition to examining gender distributions, we looked at authors' research experience, country, and work sector, and at post-publication citation statistics of the papers.

  Our main finding is that women represent only about 10% of all HPC paper authors, with large geographical variations and small variations by sector. Representation of women is particularly low among at higher experience levels.
