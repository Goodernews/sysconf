  abstract =	 "Background Although there has been a continuous
                  increase in the number of women working in the field
                  of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic
                  positions as full professors or editorial board
                  members.  Objective We aimed to determine the
                  proportion of women on the editorial boards of
                  top-ranked medical journals in different medical
                  specialties.  Methods We analyzed the gender of
                  editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of
                  12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation
                  Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were
                  included in our analysis.  Results Only 15.9% (10 of
                  63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5
                  categories, critical care, anesthesiology,
                  orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear
                  medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman
                  holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one
                  fifth (17.5%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board
                  members were women. There were significant
                  differences among the evaluated categories, with the
                  highest percentage of women in the category of
                  medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the
                  category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In
                  every category, the proportion of women as editorial
                  board members was substantially lower than that of
                  men.  Conclusions Women are underrepresented on the
                  editorial boards of major medical journals, although
                  there is a great variability among the journals and
                  categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to
                  serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible
                  sign of continuing progress and serve as important
                  role models for young women contemplating a career
                  in academic medicine."

                  determinants of outcomes for women in science and
                  engineering, we examine the effects on women's
                  percentages among undergraduate majors and among
                  degree recipients of four basic factors: (1) the
                  percentage of faculty who are women in the students'
                  major science/engineering area; (2) the students'
                  disciplines (biology, physical sciences, and
                  engineering); (3) the type of institution in which
                  students are enrolled (“Research I” vs. others); and
                  (4) a time trend (1984–2000). Method. We use
                  longitudinal, multivariate, and multi‐institutional
                  data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System
                  (IPEDS) and from a mail survey of
                  registrars. Results. Over the observation period,
                  the women's percentages have risen steadily. The
                  effects of disciplines and departments are stronger
                  than those of institutions. Especially notable is
                  that the percentages of women among undergraduate
                  science/engineering majors and degree recipients are
                  associated with the percentages of women among the
                  faculty in these fields. Conclusion. The findings
                  contribute empirically to the discussion about the
                  effects of “role models” for the participation and
                  performance of women in science and engineering—and
                  point to the strong effects of departments, compared
                  to institutions, in accounting for degrees awarded
                  to undergraduate women.}

                  faculty for promotion and tenure has generally
                  followed the dictate "publish or perish," where
                  "publish" has had its standard academic meaning of
                  "publish in archival journals" [Academic Careers,
                  94]. Relying on journal publications as the sole
                  demonstration of scholarly achievement, especially
                  counting such publications to determine whether they
                  exceed a prescribed threshold, ignores significant
                  evidence of accomplishment in computer science and
                  engineering. For example, conference publication is
                  preferred in the field, and computational artifacts
                  --software, chips, etc. --are a tangible means of
                  conveying ideas and insight. Obligating faculty to
                  be evaluated by this traditional standard handicaps
                  their careers, and indirectly harms the field. This
                  document describes appropriate evidence of academic
                  achievement in computer science and engineering.},
