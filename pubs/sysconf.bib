  abstract =	 "Background Although there has been a continuous
                  increase in the number of women working in the field
                  of medicine, women rarely reach the highest academic
                  positions as full professors or editorial board
                  members.  Objective We aimed to determine the
                  proportion of women on the editorial boards of
                  top-ranked medical journals in different medical
                  specialties.  Methods We analyzed the gender of
                  editorial board members of 60 top-ranked journals of
                  12 Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal Citation
                  Reports categories. A total of 4175 editors were
                  included in our analysis.  Results Only 15.9% (10 of
                  63) editors-in-chief were female. In the 5
                  categories, critical care, anesthesiology,
                  orthopedics, ophthalmology and radiology, nuclear
                  medicine and medical imaging, currently not 1 woman
                  holds the position of editor-in-chief. Less than one
                  fifth (17.5%, 719 of 4112) of all editorial board
                  members were women. There were significant
                  differences among the evaluated categories, with the
                  highest percentage of women in the category of
                  medicine, general and internal and the lowest in the
                  category critical care, followed by orthopedics. In
                  every category, the proportion of women as editorial
                  board members was substantially lower than that of
                  men.  Conclusions Women are underrepresented on the
                  editorial boards of major medical journals, although
                  there is a great variability among the journals and
                  categories analyzed. If more women are nominated to
                  serve on editorial boards, they will be a visible
                  sign of continuing progress and serve as important
                  role models for young women contemplating a career
                  in academic medicine."

                  is largely human and time-intensive.  More
                  worrisome, review processes are frequently
                  questioned, and often non-transparent. This work
                  advocates applying computer science methods and
                  tools to the computer science review process.  As an
                  initial exploration, we data mine the submissions,
                  bids, reviews, and decisions from a recent top-tier
                  computer net-working conference.  We empirically
                  test several common hypotheses, including the
                  existence of readability, citation, call-for-paper
                  adherence, and topical bias. From our findings, we
                  hypothesize review process methods to improve

  abstract =	 {Explanations for women’s underrepresentation in
                  math-intensive fields of science often focus on sex
                  discrimination in grant and manuscript reviewing,
                  interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women
                  scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas
                  rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and
                  programs aimed at remediation. More recent and
                  robust empiricism, however, fails to support
                  assertions of discrimination in these domains. To
                  better understand women’s underrepresentation in
                  math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise
                  claims of discrimination and their evidentiary
                  bases. Based on a review of the past 20 years of
                  data, we suggest that some of these claims are no
                  longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as
                  current causes of women’s lack of progress, can
                  delay or prevent understanding of contemporary
                  determinants of women’s underrepresentation. We
                  conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the
                  real world result from differences in resources
                  attributable to choices, whether free or
                  constrained, and that such choices could be
                  influenced and better informed through education if
                  resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus
                  on sex discrimination inreviewing, and hiring
                  represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is
                  engaged in the present in solving problems of the
                  past, rather than in addressing meaningful
                  limitations deterring women’s participation in
                  science, technology, engineering, andmathematics
                  careers today. Addressing today’s causes of
                  underrep-resentation requires focusing on education
                  and policy changesthat will make institutions
                  responsive to differing biological reali-ties of the
                  sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of
                  intervention to increase gender fairness that accord
                  with current, asopposed to historical,findings.},

  abstract =	 {1.There is a widespread perception in the academic
                  community that peer review is subject tomany biases
                  and can be influenced by the identity and biographic
                  features (such as gender) ofmanuscript authors.2.We
                  examined how patterns of authorship differ between
                  men and women, and whetherauthor gender influences
                  editorial and peer review outcomes and/or the peer
                  review process forpapers submitted to the
                  journalFunctional Ecologybetween 2010 and
                  2014.3.Women represented approximately a third of
                  all authors on papers submitted
                  toFunctionalEcology. Relative to overall frequency
                  of authorship, women were underrepresented as
                  soloauthors (26\% were women). On multi-authored
                  papers, women were also underrepresented
                  aslast/senior authors (25\% were women) but
                  overrepresented as first authors (43\% were
                  women).Women first authors were less likely than men
                  first authors to serve as corresponding and
                  sub-mitting author of their papers; this difference
                  was not influenced by the gender of the
                  lastauthor. Women were more likely to be authors on
                  papers if the last author was female.4.Papers with
                  female authors (i) were equally likely to be sent
                  for peer review, (ii) obtainedequivalent peer review
                  scores and (iii) were equally likely to be accepted
                  for publication, com-pared to papers with male
                  authors. There was no evidence that male editors or
                  male reviewerstreated papers authored by women
                  differently than did female editors and reviewers,
                  and noevidence that more senior editors reached
                  different decisions than younger editors after
                  review,or cumulative through the entire process, for
                  papers authored by men vs. women.5.Papers authored
                  by women were more likely to be reviewed by
                  women. This is primarilybecause women were more
                  likely to be invited to review if the authors on a
                  paper were femalethan if the authors were
                  male.6.Patterns of authorship, and the role
                  undertaken as author (e.g., submitting and serving
                  ascorresponding author), differ notably between men
                  and women for papers submitted toFunc-tional
                  Ecology. However, consistent with a growing body of
                  literature indicating that peerreview underlying the
                  scholarly publishing process is largely
                  gender-neutral, outcomes of edito-rial and peer
                  review atFunctional Ecologywere not influenced by
                  author gender.},

                  determinants of outcomes for women in science and
                  engineering, we examine the effects on women's
                  percentages among undergraduate majors and among
                  degree recipients of four basic factors: (1) the
                  percentage of faculty who are women in the students'
                  major science/engineering area; (2) the students'
                  disciplines (biology, physical sciences, and
                  engineering); (3) the type of institution in which
                  students are enrolled (“Research I” vs. others); and
                  (4) a time trend (1984–2000). Method. We use
                  longitudinal, multivariate, and multi‐institutional
                  data from the Integrated Postsecondary Data System
                  (IPEDS) and from a mail survey of
                  registrars. Results. Over the observation period,
                  the women's percentages have risen steadily. The
                  effects of disciplines and departments are stronger
                  than those of institutions. Especially notable is
                  that the percentages of women among undergraduate
                  science/engineering majors and degree recipients are
                  associated with the percentages of women among the
                  faculty in these fields. Conclusion. The findings
                  contribute empirically to the discussion about the
                  effects of “role models” for the participation and
                  performance of women in science and engineering—and
                  point to the strong effects of departments, compared
                  to institutions, in accounting for degrees awarded
                  to undergraduate women.}

                  has been little empirical research on gender
                  disparities in engineering which help underpin the
                  effective preparation, co-ordination, and
                  implementation of the science and technology (S&T)
                  policies. This article aims to present a
                  comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering
                  publications across different specialties and
                  provide a cross-gender analysis of research output
                  and scientific impact of engineering researchers in
                  academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For
                  this purpose, 679,338 engineering articles published
                  from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web of
                  Science database and 974,837 authorships are
                  analyzed. The structures of co-authorship
                  collaboration networks in different engineering
                  disciplines are examined, highlighting the role of
                  female scientists in the diffusion of knowledge. The
                  findings reveal that men dominate 80\% of all the
                  scientific production in engineering. Women
                  engineers publish their papers in journals with
                  higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but
                  their work receives lower recognition (fewer
                  citations) from the scientific
                  community. Engineers—regardless of their
                  gender—contribute to the reproduction of the
                  male-dominated scientific structures through forming
                  and repeating their collaborations predominantly
                  with men. The results of this study call for
                  integration of data driven gender-related policies
                  in existing S&T discourse.},

                  are appointed on the basis of their expertise
                  alone. However, it is difficult to check for any
                  bias in the peer-review process because the identity

                  about the existence and extent ofmany hypothesized

                  faculty for promotion and tenure has generally
                  followed the dictate "publish or perish," where
                  "publish" has had its standard academic meaning of
                  "publish in archival journals" [Academic Careers,
                  94]. Relying on journal publications as the sole
                  demonstration of scholarly achievement, especially
                  counting such publications to determine whether they
                  exceed a prescribed threshold, ignores significant
                  evidence of accomplishment in computer science and
                  engineering. For example, conference publication is
                  preferred in the field, and computational artifacts
                  --software, chips, etc. --are a tangible means of
                  conveying ideas and insight. Obligating faculty to
                  be evaluated by this traditional standard handicaps
                  their careers, and indirectly harms the field. This

  abstract =	 {This article examines gender bias in peer review
                  with complete data on 145 journals in various fields
                  of research, including about 1.7 million authors and
                  740,000 referees.  We reconstructed three possible
                  sources of bias, i.e., the editorial selection of
                  referees, referee recommendations, andeditorial
                  decisions, and examined all their possible
                  relationships.  In line with previous research, we
                  found that editors were sensitive to gender
                  homophily in that they tended to match authors and
                  referee by gender systematically.  Results showed
                  that in general manuscripts written by women as solo
                  authors or co-authored by women are treated even
                  more favorably by referees and editors.  This is
                  especially so in biomedicine and health journals,
                  whereas women were treated relatively less favorably
                  in social science & humanities journals, i.e., the
                  field in which the ratio offemale authors was the
                  highest in our sample.  Although with some caveat,
                  our findings suggestthat peer review and editorial
                  processes in scholarly journals do not penalize
                  manuscripts bywomen.  However, considering the
                  complex social nature of gender prejudices, journals
                  shouldincrease gender diversity among reviewers and
                  editors as a means of correcting signals
                  potentiallybiasing the perceptions of authors and
                  referees.},
