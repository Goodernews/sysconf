# Differences in Reception {#sec:reception}

 * Citation numbers, by country
 * Citation velocity
 * Effect (and #) of first-authorship or other position

Another interesting observation is that the percentage of female lead authors is slightly higher than the percentage of female authors overall. Typically, authors in CS papers are listed in descending order of contribution (only `r more2 <- filter(roles, role == "author") %>% group_by(key) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% filter(n > 2) %>% left_join(papers); pct(sum(more2$alphabetized), nrow(more2),3 )`% of the `r nrow(more2)` papers in our data set with three or more authors have alphabetical author order). The same-or-better rate of female lead authors in our data set contradicts findings for some other fields [@cite].

Exclude single-author and two-author papers from % count
