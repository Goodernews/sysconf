Dave Evans, CCS: "I think the author responses are valuable, even if they don't change paper decisions since (1) they make reviewers take the early reviews more seriously and know they risk being embarrassed if they say something incorrect/lazy, (2) they give authors a sense that they had an opportunity to respond, and (3) they help PC chairs decide if a paper needs additional reviews. I think the responses did change the outcomes of some papers for CCS - one for sure, that was considered dropped after the first round, but revived by the responses and eventually accepted, and for the borderline papers, the responses were considered seriously in making decisions (but can't know for sure how things would have gone without them). In some cases, the authors responses made it easier to reject papers since they made it clear that the problems reviewers found were legitimate, and a handful of papers were withdraw by the authors after seeing the early reviews.  We had a "Discussion Committee" that assigned a PC member to oversee each paper to ensure the reviewers took the author responses into consideration, which helped a lot since for a conference of this scale it would be too much for the PC chairs to check on all papers."

* Are awards "random"? how many times were award papers previously rejected? What's the correlation with review score distributions?
http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/12/15/the-nips-experiment.html

* Correlate everything with conference metrics and policies (features)

* Relationship between english mastery and presentation scores/overall scores

* Correlation among different review scoresHow correlated are all the grades? conversely, if one reviewer loves a paper and another hates it, can they disagree even on "presentation"?

* Compare "overall" average to confidence-weighted "overall" average

* How does the average number of reviews compare to other fields?

## Review policies

* Effect of reviewer award on their own submissions?

* Textual difference between 1st-version pre-print, last version, and published version. Not just similarity, but change in meaning

* Does-double blind really help quality in any way? How about non-blind review where reviewers "sign" their review

* Does it lead to more balanced geography/institution/gender bias?

* Does it lead to more citations?

* Properties of "real" papers, based on Ulfar's email from 10/4/17
