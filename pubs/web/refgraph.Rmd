# Citation Graph Analysis {#ch:refgraph}


## Goal
Citation graphs are collections of data linking publications that cite other publications. These publications may be scholarly articles, patents, or books, for example. A citation graph represents a type of a social network, with rich relationships between citing/cited authors, conferences, topics, institutes etc. Analyzing complex citation graphs often reveals new insights on the entire field from which the publications come.^[This chapter was supported by the work of Henry Blanchette and a grant from Center and Teaching Technologies at Reed College.]

Extracted bibliography information using CERMINE [@tkaczyk14:cermine]. (actually just Sem. Scholar)

Cite amar:18 for disambiguation of cited papers (actually used Semantic Scholar)
