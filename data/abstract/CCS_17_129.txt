the square-root of the verification circuit size. The protocol can
be based on any collision-resistant hash function. Alternatively, it
can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model, yielding
concretely efficient zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup
or public-key cryptography.

Our protocol is attractive not only for very large verification
circuits but also for moderately large circuits that arise in applications. For instance, for verifying a SHA-256 preimage in zeroknowledge with 2~* soundness error, the communication complexity is roughly 44KB (or less than 34KB under a plausible conjecture),
the prover running time is 140 ms, and the verifier running time is
62 ms. This proof is roughly 4 times shorter than a similar proof
of ZKB++ (Chase et al., CCS 2017), an optimized variant of ZKBoo
(Giacomelli et al., USENIX 2016).

The communication complexity of our protocol is independent of
the circuit structure and depends only on the number of gates. For
24° soundness error, the communication becomes smaller than the
circuit size for circuits containing roughly 3 million gates or more.
Our efficiency advantages become even bigger in an amortized
setting, where several instances need to be proven simultaneously.

Our zero-knowledge protocol is obtained by applying an optimized version of the general transformation of Ishai et al. (STOC
2007) to a variant of the protocol for secure multiparty computation of Damgard and Ishai (Crypto 2006). It can be viewed as
a simple zero-knowledge interactive PCP based on “interleaved”
Reed-Solomon codes.
