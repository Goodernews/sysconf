latency variance, and degraded throughput which is problematic when users are fetching and storing content for interactive
applications. This can be attributed to performance hotspots
created by slow nodes in a storage cluster, and performance
interference caused by multi-tenancy, and background tasks
such as data scrubbing, backfilling, recovery, etc. In this paper,
we present DLR, a system that improves the performance
of cloud storage services in the presence of hardware heterogeneity, and performance interference through a dynamic
load redistribution technique. We designed DLR to dynamically
adjust the load serving ratio of storage servers based on the
system-level performance measurements from the storage cluster. We implemented DLR using Ceph, a popular distributed
object storage system, and evaluated its performance on NSFCloud’s Chameleon testbed using Ceph’s Rados benchmark.
Experimental results show that DLR improves the average
throughput and latency of Ceph storage by up to 65%, and
41% respectively compared to the default case. Compared to
Ceph’s in-built load balancing technique, DLR improves the
throughput by up to 98%, and latency by 96%.
