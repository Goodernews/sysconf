for data curation specialists, it becomes unfeasible for nonexpert users, who are unacquainted with the semantics and
languages of the involved transformations.

In this paper, we present an interactive framework for
schema mapping specification suited for non-expert users.
The underlying key intuition is to leverage a few exemplar
tuples to infer the underlying mappings and iterate the inference process via simple user interactions under the form
of boolean queries on the validity of the initial exemplar
tuples. The approaches available so far are mainly assuming pairs of complete universal data examples, which can be
solely provided by data curation experts, or are limited to
poorly expressive mappings.

We present several exploration strategies of the space of
all possible mappings that satisfy arbitrary user exemplar
tuples. Along the exploration, we challenge the user to retain the mappings that fit the userâ€™s requirements at best
and to dynamically prune the exploration space, thus reducing the number of user interactions. We prove that after the
refinement process, the obtained mappings are correct. We
present an extensive experimental analysis devoted to measure the feasibility of our interactive mapping strategies and
the inherent quality of the obtained mappings.
