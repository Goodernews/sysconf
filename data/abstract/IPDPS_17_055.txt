
Aces4 is a parallel programming platform comprising a DSL for Computational Chemistry and its runtime
system. It offers a convenient way to express parallelism
together with extensive support for extremely large, possibly
sparse distributed arrays. It aids scientists in the creation and
use of performant, scalable, massively parallel programs that
can effectively take advantage of leadership class computing
systems to address important scientific questions. Aces4 has
enabled the development and implementation of new methods
in electronic structure theory which are breaking new ground
in their ability to perform highly accurate calculations on ever
larger molecular systems. In this paper, the design of Aces4 is
described along with scaling results from a Molecular Cluster
Perturbation Theory calculation, one of the new methods
enabled by Aces4.
