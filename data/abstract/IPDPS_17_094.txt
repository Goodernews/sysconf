
Limited power budgets will be one of the biggest
challenges for deploying future exascale supercomputers. One
of the promising ways to deal with this challenge is hardware
overprovisioning, that is, installing more hardware resources than
can be fully powered under a given power limit coupled with
software mechanisms to steer the limited power to where it is
needed most. Prior research has demonstrated the viability of
this approach, but could only rely on small-scale simulations of
the software stack. While such research is useful to understand
the boundaries of performance benefits that can be achieved, it
does not cover any deployment or operational concerns of using
overprovisioning on production systems.

This paper is the first to present an extensible power-aware
resource management framework for production-sized
overprovisioned systems based on the widely established
SLURM resource manager. Our framework provides flexible
plugin interfaces and APIs for power management that can
be easily extended to implement site-specific strategies and for
comparison of different power management techniques. We
demonstrate our framework on a 965-node HA8000 production
system at Kyushu University. Our results indicate that it is
indeed possible to safely overprovision hardware in production.
We also find that the power consumption of idle nodes, which
depends on the degree of overprovisioning, can become a
bottleneck. Using real-world data, we then draw conclusions
about the impact of the total number of nodes provided in an
overprovisioned environment.
