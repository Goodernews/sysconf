
In many organizations, it is often challenging for users to find relevant data for specific tasks, since the data is usually scattered across
the enterprise and often inconsistent. In fact, data scientists routinely
report that the majority of their effort is spent finding, cleaning, integrating, and accessing data of interest to a task at hand. In order
to decrease the “grunt work” needed to facilitate the analysis of
data “in the wild”, we present DATA CIVILIZER, an end-to-end big
data management system. DATA CIVILIZER has a linkage graph
computation module to build a linkage graph for the data and a data
discovery module which utilizes the linkage graph to help identify
data that is relevant to user tasks. It also uses the linkage graph
to discover possible join paths that can then be used in a query.
For the actual query execution, we use a polystore DBMS, which
federates query processing across disparate systems. In addition,
DATA CIVILIZER integrates data cleaning operations into query pro-
cessing. Because different users need to invoke the above tasks in
different orders, DATA CIVILIZER embeds a workflow engine which
enables the arbitrary composition of different modules, as well as
the handling of data updates. We have deployed our preliminary
DATA CIVILIZER system in two institutions, MIT and Merck and
describe initial positive experiences that show the system shortens
the time and effort required to find, prepare, and analyze data.
