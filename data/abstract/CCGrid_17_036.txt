
Network messaging delay historically constitutes a
large portion of the wall-clock time for High Performance
Computing (HPC) applications, as these applications run on
many nodes and involve intensive communication among their
tasks. Dragonfly network topology has emerged as a promising
solution for building exascale HPC systems owing to its low
network diameter and large bisection bandwidth. Dragonfly
includes local links that form groups and global links that connect
these groups via high bandwidth optical links. Many aspects of
the dragonfly network design are yet to be explored, such as the
performance impact of the connectivity of the global links, i.e.,
global link arrangements, the bandwidth of the local and global
links, or the job allocation algorithm.
This paper first introduces a packet-level simulation framework to model the performance of HPC applications in detail.
The proposed framework is able to simulate known MPI (message
passing interface) routines as well as applications with customdefined communication patterns for a given job placement algorithm and network topology. Using this simulation framework,
we investigate the coupling between global link bandwidth
and arrangements, communication pattern and intensity, job
allocation and task mapping algorithms, and routing mechanisms
in dragonfly topologies. We demonstrate that by choosing the
right combination of system settings and workload allocation
algorithms, communication overhead can be decreased by up
to 44%. We also show that circulant arrangement provides
up to 15% higher bisection bandwidth compared to the other
arrangements; but for realistic workloads, the performance
impact of link arrangements is less than 3%.
