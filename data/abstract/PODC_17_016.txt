maximum weight independent set (MaxIS) in the CONGEST model
which completes in O(MIS(G) - log W) rounds, where A is the maximum degree, MIS(G) is the number of rounds needed to compute a
maximal independent set (MIS) on G, and W is the maximum weight
of a node. Plugging in the best known algorithm for MIS gives a
randomized solution in O(log n log W) rounds, where n is the number of nodes. We also present a deterministic O(A + log* n)-round
algorithm based on coloring.

We then show how to use our MaxIS approximation algorithms to
compute a 2-approximation for maximum weight matching without
incurring any additional round penalty in the CONGEST model.
We use a known reduction for simulating algorithms on the line
graph while incurring congestion, but we show our algorithm is
part of a broad family of local aggregation algorithms for which
we describe a mechanism that allows the simulation to run in the
CONGEST model without an additional overhead.

Next, we show that for maximum weight matching, relaxing the
approximation factor to (2 + ¢) allows us to devise a distributed
algorithm requiring O(geEe a) rounds for any constant ¢ > 0. For
the unweighted case, we can even obtain a (1 + ¢)-approximation
in this number of rounds. These algorithms are the first to achieve
the provably optimal round complexity with respect to dependency
on ∆
