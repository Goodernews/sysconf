
We develop Propane/AT, a system to synthesize provably-
correct BGP (border gateway protocol) configurations for
large, evolving networks from high-level specifications of
topology, routing policy, and fault-tolerance requirements.
Propane/AT is based on new abstractions for capturing pa-
rameterized network topologies and their evolution, and al-
gorithms to analyze the impact of topology and routing pol-
icy on fault tolerance. Our algorithms operate entirely on ab-
stract topologies. We prove that the properties established
by our analyses hold for every concrete instantiation of the
given abstract topology. Propane/AT also guarantees that
only incremental changes to existing device configurations
are required when the network evolves to add or remove de-
vices and links. Our experiments with real-world topologies
and policies show that our abstractions and algorithms are
effective, and that, for large networks, Propane/AT synthe-
sizes configurations two orders of magnitude faster than sys-
tems that operate on concrete topologies.
