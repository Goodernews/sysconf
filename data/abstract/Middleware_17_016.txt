
The rapid adoption of smartphones with different types of
advanced sensors has led to an increasing trend in the usage
of mobile crowdsensing applications, e.g. , to create hyperlocal weather maps. However, the high energy consumption
of crowdsensing, chiefly due to expensive network communication, has been found to be detrimental to the wide-spread
adoption. We propose a framework, called SENSE-AID, that
can provide energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing service,
coexisting with the cellular network. There are two key
innovations in SENSE-AID beyond prior work (Piggyback
Crowdsensing-Sensys13)â€”the middleware running on the
cellular network edge to orchestrate multiple devices present
in geographical proximity to suppress redundant data collection and communication. It understands the state of each
device (radio state, battery state, etc.) to decide which ones
should be selected for crowdsensing activities at any point
in time. It also provides a simple programming abstraction
to help with the development of crowdsensing applications.
We show the benefit of SENsE-Arp by conducting a user
study consisting of 60 students in our campus, compared
to a baseline periodic data collection method and Piggyback Crowdsensing. We find that energy saving is 93.3%
for SENSE-AID compared with Piggyback Crowdsensing in
a representative case which requires 2 devices to provide
barometric values within an area of a circle whose radius
is 1 kilometer and requires periodic data collection every
5 minutes for a 90-minute test. The selection algorithm of
SENSE-AID also ensures reasonable fairness in the use of the
different devices.
