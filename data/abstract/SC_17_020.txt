attractive performance for data parallel codes. However, communicating between GPUs across the cluster is cumbersome when
compared to CPU networking implementations. A number of recent
works have enabled GPUs to more naturally access the network,
but suffer from performance problems, require hidden CPU helper
threads, or restrict communications to kernel boundaries.
In this paper, we propose GPU Triggered Networking, a novel,
GPU-centric networking approach which leverages the best of
CPUs and GPUs. In this model, CPUs create and stage network
messages and GPUs trigger the network interface when data is
ready to send. GPU Triggered Networking decouples these two
operations, thereby removing the CPU from the critical path. We
illustrate how this approach can provide up to 25% speedup compared to standard GPU networking across microbenchmarks, a
Jacobi stencil, an important MPI collective operation, and machinelearning workloads.
