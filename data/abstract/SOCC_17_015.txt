to persuade the website owners to migrate their contents onto the
cloud infrastructure, besides the advantages of cloud infrastructure in terms of flexibility, efficiency, scalability and elasticity. The
emerging Keyless SSL solution retains on-premise custody of customers’ SSL private keys on their own servers. However, it suffers
from significant performance degradation and limited scalability,
caused by the long distance connection to Key Server for each new
coming end-user request. The performance improvements using
persistent session and key caching onto cloud will degrade the key
invulnerability and discourage the website owners because of the
cloud’s security bugs.

In this paper, the challenges of secured key protection and distribution are addressed in philosophy of “Storing the trusted DATA on
untrusted platform and transmitting through untrusted channel”.
To this end, a three-phase hierarchical key management scheme,
called STYX! is proposed to provide the secured key protection together with hardware assisted service acceleration for cloud-based
content delivery network (CCDN) applications. The STYX is implemented based on Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), Intel
QuickAssist Technology (QAT) and SIGMA (SIGn-and-MAc) protocol. STYX can provide the tight key security guarantee by SGX
based key distribution with a light overhead, and it can further
significantly enhance the system performance with QAT based acceleration. The comprehensive evaluations show that the STYX
not only guarantees the absolute security but also outperforms
the direct HTTPS server deployed CDN without QAT by up to 5x
throughput with significant latency reduction at the same time.
