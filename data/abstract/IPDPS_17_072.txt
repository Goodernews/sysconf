
Limited power budget is becoming one of the
most crucial challenges in developing supercomputer systems.
Hardware overprovisioning which installs a larger number of
nodes beyond the limitations of the power constraint is an
attractive way to design next generation supercomputers. In air
cooled HPC centers, about half of the total power is consumed
by cooling facilities. Reducing cooling power and effectively
utilizing power resource for computing nodes are important
challenges. It is known that the cooling power depends on
the hotspot temperature of the node inlets. Therefore, if we
minimize the hotspot temperature, performance efficiency of
the HPC system will be increased.

One of the ways to reduce the hotspot temperature is to
allocate power-hungry jobs to compute nodes whose effect
on the hotspot temperature is small. It can be accomplished
by optimizing job-to-node mapping in the job scheduler. In
this paper, we propose a cooling and node location-aware
job scheduling strategy which tries to optimize job-to-node
mapping while improving the total system throughput under
the constraint of total system (compute nodes and cooling
facilities) power consumption. Experimental results with the
job scheduling simulation show that our scheduling scheme
achieves 1.49X higher total system throughput than the conventional scheme.
