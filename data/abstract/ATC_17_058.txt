
Non-volatile memory (NVM) and remote direct memory
access (RDMA) provide extremely high performance
in storage and network hardware. However, existing
distributed file systems strictly isolate file system and
network layers, and the heavy layered software designs leave high-speed hardware under-exploited. In
this paper, we propose an RDMA-enabled distributed
persistent memory file system, Octopus, to redesign file
system internal mechanisms by closely coupling NVM
and RDMA features. For data operations, Octopus
directly accesses a shared persistent memory pool to
reduce memory copying overhead, and actively fetches
and pushes data all in clients to re-balance the load between the server and network. For metadata operations,
Octopus introduces self-identified RPC for immediate
notification between file systems and networking, and
an efficient distributed transaction mechanism for consistency. Evaluations show that Octopus achieves nearly
the raw bandwidth for large I/Os and orders of magnitude
better performance than existing distributed file systems.
