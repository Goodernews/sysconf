evolution that allows both node and edge arrivals. Starting with
an arbitrary nonempty graph Go, at each time step, there are two
possible events: with probability p > 0 a new node arrives and a
new edge is added between the new node and an existing node, and
with probability 1 — p a new edge is added between two existing
nodes. In both cases, the involved existing nodes are chosen at
random according to preferential attachment, ie., with probability
proportional to their degree. G(p) is known to generate power law
networks, i.e., the fraction of nodes with degree k is proportional to
k-, Here B = (4 - p)/(2 —p) is in the range (2,3].

Denoting the number of nodes of degree k at time t by my, we
significantly improve some long-standing results. In particular, we
show that m, , is concentrated around its mean with a deviation
of O( Vt), which is independent of k. We also tightly bound the
expectation E [mg, r| with an additive error of O(1/k), which is
independent of t. These new bounds allow us to tightly estimate
my, for a considerably larger k values than before. This, in turn,
enables us to estimate other important quantities, e.g., the size of
the k-rich club, namely, the set of all nodes with a degree at least k.

Finally, we introduce a new generalized model, G(p;,71,q2),
which extends G(p) by allowing also time-varying probabilities
for node and edge arrivals, as well as the formation of new components. We show that the extended model can produce power law
networks with any exponent f in the range (1,00). Furthermore,
the concentration bounds established for m,,; in G(p) also apply
in G(pr,rt, qt).
