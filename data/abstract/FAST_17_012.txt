
We present Omid â€” a transaction processing service that
powers web-scale production systems at Yahoo. Omid
provides ACID transaction semantics on top of traditional key-value storage; its implementation over Apache
HBase is open sourced as part of Apache Incubator.
Omid can serve hundreds of thousands of transactions
per second on standard mid-range hardware, while incurring minimal impact on the speed of data access in
the underlying key-value store. Additionally, as expected
from always-on production services, Omid is highly
available.
