
Distributed burst buffers are a promising storage
architecture for handling I/O workloads for exascale computing.
Their aggregate storage bandwidth grows linearly with system
node count. However, although scientific applications can achieve
scalable write bandwidth by having each process write to its
node-local burst buffer, metadata challenges remain formidable,
especially for files shared across many processes. This is due to the
need to track and organize file segments across the distributed
burst buffers in a global index. Because this global index can
be accessed concurrently by thousands or more processes in a
scientific application, the scalability of metadata management is
a severe performance-limiting factor.

In this paper, we propose MetaKV: a key-value store that
provides fast and scalable metadata management for HPC
metadata workloads on distributed burst buffers. MetaKV complements the functionality of an existing key-value store with
specialized metadata services that efficiently handle bursty and
concurrent metadata workloads: compressed storage management, supervised block clustering, and log-ring based collective
message reduction. Our experiments demonstrate that MetaKV
outperforms the state-of-the-art key-value stores by a significant
margin. It improves put and get metadata operations by as much
as 2.66 and 6.29x, respectively, and the benefits of MetaKV
increase with increasing metadata workload demand.
