that they often require a developer to be in the loop. As
such, it is difficult for an organization to deploy multiple
crowdsourced EM solutions, because there are simply not
enough developers. To address this problem, a recent work
has proposed Corleone, a solution that crowdsources the entire EM workflow, requiring no developers. While promising, Corleone is severely limited in that it does not scale to
large tables. We propose Falcon, a solution that scales up
the hands-off crowdsourced EM approach of Corleone, using RDBMS-style query execution and optimization over a
Hadoop cluster. Specifically, we define a set of operators and
develop efficient implementations. We translate a hands-off
crowdsourced EM workflow into a plan consisting of these
operators, optimize, then execute the plan. These plans involve both machine and crowd activities, giving rise to novel
optimization techniques such as using crowd time to mask
machine time. Extensive experiments show that Falcon can
scale up to tables of millions of tuples, thus providing a
practical solution for hands-off crowdsourced EM, to build
cloud-based EM services.
