
Hybrid data center networks (HDCNs), where each
ToR switch is installed with a directional antenna, emerge as a
candidate helping alleviate the over-subscription problem in traditional data centers. Meanwhile, as virtualization techniques develop
rapidly, there is a trend that traditional network functions that
are implemented in hardware will also be virtualized into virtual
machines. However, how to place virtual network functions (VNFs)
into data centers to meet the customer requirements in a hybrid
data center network environment is a challenging problem. In this
paper, we study the VNF placement in hybrid data center networks,
and provide a joint VNF placement and antenna scheduling model.
We further simplify it to a mixed integer programming (MIP)
problem. Due to the hardness of a MIP problem, we develop
a heuristic algorithm to solve it. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work concerning VNF placement in the context of
HDCNs. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm, which make it a very suitable and
promising solution for VNF placement in HDCN environment.
