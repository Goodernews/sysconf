
Since the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) was first
proposed, there is a large family of approaches that is derived
from it. For the reason that the existing local outliers detection
approaches only focus on the extent of overall separation between
an object and its neighbors, and do not pay attention to the degree of dispersion between them, the precision of these approaches will be seriously affected in the scattered data sets for outlier
detection. In this paper, we redefine the local outliers by combining the degree of dispersion of the object and its neighbors, and
propose a new local outlier detection approach (N2DLOF). Compared to conventional approaches, the outliers obtained by
N2DLOF are more sensitive to the degree of anomaly of the scattered data sets. Experiments show that our approach has a significant improvement on outlier detection precision in the case of
scattered datasets with similar time complexity. In short, we extend the ecosystem of the local outlier detection approaches from
a new perspective.
