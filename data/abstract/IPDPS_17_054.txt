such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) requires both more
efficient hardware and algorithms than todayâ€™s technology provides. The recently introduced image-domain gridding (DG)
algorithm is a novel approach towards solving the most computeintensive parts of creating sky images: gridding and degridding. It
avoids the performance bottlenecks of traditional AW-projection
gridding by applying instrumental and environmental corrections
in the image domain instead of in the Fourier domain. In this
paper, we present the first implementations of this new algorithm
for CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). A thorough performance analysis, in which we apply a modified roofline analysis,
shows that our parallelization approaches and optimization leads
to nearly optimal performance on all architectures. The analysis
also indicates that, by leveraging dedicated hardware to evaluate
trigonometric functions, GPUs are both much faster and more
energy-efficient than regular CPUs. This makes IDG on GPUs
a candidate for meeting the computational and energy-efficiency
constraints of future telescopes.
