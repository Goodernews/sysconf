
Colocation data centers (or colocations, for short)
are important participants in emergency demand response (EDR)
programs. One key challenge in colocations is that tenants control
their own servers, thus, may not coordinate to reduce their power
consumption. In this paper, we propose a joint truthful incentive
mechanism Co-Colo to encourage tenants joining EDR programs,
which includes a local optimization mechanism (LocalOpt) and
a global optimization mechanism (GlobalOpt). In LocalOpt, tenants are motivated to improve the energy efficiency locally. In
GlobalOpt, tenants can request some public server resources to
improve the energy efficiency. By jointly considering the two
mechanisms, Co-Colo effectively reduces the energy-saving cost.
A (1 + â‚¬)-approximation algorithm is proposed to obtain the
asymptotic optimal energy-saving scheme. We also consider a
special case when the public resources are sufficient, and design
a 2-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, the robustness of the
proposed algorithms are proved. Trace-driven simulations verify
the effectiveness and feasibility of Co-Colo.
