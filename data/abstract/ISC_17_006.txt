for constantly-evolving dynamic graphs. Modern GPUs provide massive
amount of parallelism for efficient graph processing, but the challenges
remain due to their lack of support for the near real-time streaming
nature of dynamic graphs. Specifically, due to the current high volume and velocity of graph data combined with the complexity of user
queries, traditional processing methods by first storing the updates and
then repeatedly running static graph analytics on a sequence of versions or snapshots are deemed undesirable and computational infeasible
on GPU. We present EvoGraph, a highly efficient and scalable GPUbased dynamic graph analytics framework that incrementally processes
graphs on-the-fly using fixed-sized batches of updates. The runtime realizes this vision with a user friendly programming model, along with a
vertex property-based optimization to choose between static and incremental execution; and efficient utilization of all hardware resources using
GPU streams, including its computational and data movement engines.
Extensive experimental evaluations for a wide variety of graph inputs
and algorithms demonstrate that EvoGraph achieves up to 429 million
updates/sec and over 2321 speedup compared to the competing frameworks such as STINGER.
