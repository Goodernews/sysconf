
The complete Voronoi map of a binary image with
black and white pixels is a matrix of the same size such that each
element is the closest black pixel of the corresponding pixel. The
complete Voronoi map visualizes the influence region of each
black pixel. However, each region may not be connected due
to exclave pixels. The connected Voronoi map is a modification
of the complete Voronoi map so that all regions are connected.
The Euclidean distance map of a binary image is a matrix, in
which each element is the distance to the closest black pixel.
It has many applications of image processing such as dilation,
erosion, deblurring effects, skeletonizing and matching. The main
contribution of this paper is to present simple and fast parallel
algorithms for computing the complete/connected Voronoi maps
and the Euclidean distance map and implement them in the
GPU. Our parallel algorithm first computes the mixed Voronoi
map, which is a mixture of the complete and connected Voronoi
maps, and then converts it into the complete/connected Voronoi
by exposing/hiding all exclave pixels. After that, the complete
Voronoi map is converted into the Euclidean distance map by
computing the distance to the closest black pixel for every pixel in
an obvious way. The experimental results on GeForce GTX 1080
GPU show that the computing time for these conversions is
relatively small. The throughput of our GPU implementation
for computing the Euclidean distance maps of 2K x 2.K binary
images is up to 2.08 times larger than the previously published
best GPU implementation, and up to 172 times larger than CPU
implementation using Intel Core i7-4790.
