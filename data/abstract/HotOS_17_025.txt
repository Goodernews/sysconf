Encryption allows a user to hide the contents of data, but not
the fact that sensitive data is present. Under duress, the owner
of high-value data can be coerced by a powerful adversary to
disclose decryption keys. Thus, private users and corporations
have an interest in hiding the very presence of some sensitive
data, alongside a larger body of less sensitive data (e.g., the
operating system and other benign files); this property is called
plausible deniability. Existing plausible deniability systems do
not fulfill all of the following requirements: (1) resistance to
multiple snapshot attacks where an attacker compares the state
of the device over time; (2) ensuring that hidden data wonâ€™t
be destroyed when the public volume is modified by a user
unaware of the hidden data; and (3) disguising writes to secret
data as normal system operations on public data.

We explain why existing solutions do not meet all these
requirements and present the Ever-Changing Disk (ECD), a
generic scheme for plausible deniability storage systems that
meets all of these requirements. An ECD stores hidden data
inside a large volume of pseudorandom data. Portions of this
volume are periodically migrated in a log-structured manner.
Hidden writes can then be interchanged with normal firmware
operations. The expected access patterns and time until hidden
data is overwritten are completely predictable, and insensitive
to whether data is hidden. Users control the rate of internal
data migration (R), trading write bandwidth to hidden data for
longevity of the hidden data. For a typical 2TB disk and setting
of R, a user preserves hidden data by entering her secret key
every few days or weeks.
