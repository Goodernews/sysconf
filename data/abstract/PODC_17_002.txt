adversarial packet injections. We focus on the model of adversarial
queuing theory, where each packet is injected into the network
with a prescribed path to its destination, and both the long-range
average rate and the short-range burst size are bounded. Each edge
has an associated buffer that stores packets while they wait to cross
the edge. Our goal is to minimize the buffer space required to avoid
overflows.

Previous results for local forwarding protocols required buffers
of size Q(n). In the case of single destination trees, it is known that
for centralized protocols, buffers of size O(1) are sufficient. We show
that for local protocols, buffers of size @(log n) are necessary and
sufficient for single destination trees. The upper bound is achieved
by a novel protocol which we call Odd-Even Downhill forwarding
(OED). We also show that even slightly more general networks—
such as path graphs with multiple destinations, or DAGs with a
single destination—require buffers of size Q(n) to avoid overflows,
even if forwarding is done by centralized, offline protocols.
