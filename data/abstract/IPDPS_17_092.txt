
We give efficient algorithms to solve fundamental data movement problems on mesh-connected computers
augmented with limited global bandwidth. Adding a small
amount of global bandwidth makes a practical design that
combines aspects of mesh and fully connected models to achieve
the benefits of each. We give algorithms for sorting, finding
the median, finding a spanning tree, and determining various
graph properties to show that the small amount of global
communication can significantly reduce the time, and that
concurrent read helps even more. Most of these algorithms
are optimal. We also extend our results to mesh-connected
computers with row and column buses.
