a combination of a graph pattern and an attribute dependency. In a uniform format, GEDs express graph functional
dependencies with constant literals to catch inconsistencies,
and keys carrying id literals to identify entities in a graph.
We revise the chase for GEDs and prove its Church-Rosser
property. We characterize GED satisfiability and implication, and establish the complexity of these problems and the
validation problem for GEDs, in the presence and absence of
constant literals and id literals. We also develop a sound
and complete axiom system for finite implication of GEDs.
In addition, we extend GEDs with built-in predicates or disjunctions, to strike a balance between the expressive power
and complexity. We settle the complexity of the satisfiability, implication and validation problems for the extensions.
