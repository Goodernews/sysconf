
Straggler task is commonly considered as the major
bottleneck in parallel data processing. Previous work mainly
focuses on the coarse-grained straggler detection and optimization such as speculative scheduling. However, fine-grained rootcause analysis of straggler tasks is rarely considered. In addition,
existing work simply depends on empirical analysis, which lacks
of useful guidance to performance optimization. In this paper, we
propose a new methodology of fine-grained straggler root-cause
analysis using machine learning. We collect raw metrics from
Spark event log and hardware sampling tool, and refine them into
high-level metrics for model learning. Then we present the rootcause analysis of stragglers through CART tree. A customized
prune method is also applied to improve analysis accuracy. From
the analysis, we derive several new findings beyond the well
known causes of stragglers. Our work provides a new perspective
on identifying and understanding the inefficiency in parallel data
processing programs by applying machine learning techniques to
fine-grained root-cause analysis of straggler tasks.
