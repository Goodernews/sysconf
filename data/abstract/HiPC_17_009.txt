
 Neuromorphic computing is a promising
candidate to accelerate big data processing. Recently,
several attempts have been made to design neuromorphic
accelerators for popular machine learning algorithms,
such as reservoir computing, deep learning, spiking
neurons etc. Deep learning accelerator which involves
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received
widespread attention for their accuracy and efficiency.
This paper proposes ConvLight, a novel deep learning
accelerator based on memristor integrated photonic
computing framework. While the use of on-chip photonic
circuits for analog computing is well known, no prior work
has demonstrated a full-fledged accelerator based on
photonic components. In particular, this paper makes the
following novel contributions: (i) A multilayer deep
learning architecture design is proposed using compute
efficient memristors and photonic components for the first
time. (ii) A pipelined design for each CNN layer is
presented for maximizing throughput and _ enabling
parallelism across the layers. (iii) Simulation of ConvLight
architecture with standard photonic tools for
demonstrating the execution of DNN and CNN workloads
yielding 25X, 60X, and 40X improvements in
computational efficiency, throughput, and energy
efficiency (respectively) compared to state-of-the-art
design.
