
Scientific workflows have become a popular computational model in a variety of application domains, such as
astronomy, material science, physics, and biology. As scientific
applications are moving to the cloud to take advantage of
the elasticity and service level agreement of resources, there
has been a number of recent research efforts on cloudbased workflow systems that support various types of performance guarantees under resource cost constraints. However,
most of the related work often requires advanced knowledge
about workflow structures to perform scheduling and resource
optimization. In addition, existing workflow systems usually
employ a monolithic approach in workflow implementation
and execution, which makes them inefficient in dealing with
heterogeneous types of workflows. In this paper, we present
MONAD, a self-adaptive micro-service infrastructure for heterogeneous scientific workflows. Specifically, our micro-service
architecture helps improve the flexibility of workflow composition and execution, and enables fine-grained scheduling at task
level, considering task sharing across different workflows. In
addition, we employ a feedback control approach with artificial
neural network-based system identification to provide resource
adaptation without any advanced knowledge of workflow
structures. Our evaluation on multiple realistic heterogeneous
workflows demonstrates that our system is robust and efficient
in dealing with dynamic scientific workloads.
