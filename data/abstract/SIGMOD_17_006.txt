active areas of research in computer science. While various IM
techniques proposed over the last decade have definitely enriched
the field, unfortunately, experimental reports on existing techniques
fall short in validity and integrity since many comparisons are not
based on a common platform or merely discussed in theory. In this
paper, we perform an in-depth benchmarking study of IM techniques on social networks. Specifically, we design a benchmarking
platform, which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing
techniques systematically and thoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze and diagnose
the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the
open challenges in IM even after a decade of research. More fundamentally, we unearth and debunk a series of myths and establish
that there is no single state-of-the-art technique in IM. At best, a
technique is the state of the art in only one aspect.
