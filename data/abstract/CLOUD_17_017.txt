
Due to the centralized control, network-wide monitoring and flow-level scheduling of Software-Defined-Networking
(SDN), it can be utilized to achieve Quality of Service (QoS)
for cloud applications and services, such as voice over IP,
video conference and online games, etc. However, most existing
approaches stay at the QoS framework design and test level, while
few works focus on studying the basic QoS techniques supported
by SDN. In this paper, we enable SDN with QoS guaranteed
abilities, which could provide end-to-end QoS routing for each
cloud user service. First of all, we implement an application
identification technique on SDN controller to determine required
QoS levels for each application type. Then, we implement a queue
scheduling technique on SDN switch. It queues the application
flows into different queues and schedules the flows out of
the queues with different priorities. At last, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed SDN-based QoS technique through
an experimental analysis. Results show that when the output
interface has sufficiently available bandwidth, the delay can be
reduced by 28% on average. In addition, for the application flow
with the highest priority, our methods can reduce 99.99% delay
and increase 90.17% throughput on average when the output
interface utilization approaches to the maximum bandwidth
limitation.
