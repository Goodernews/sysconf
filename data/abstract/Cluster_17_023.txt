
As hardware vendors provision more cores and
faster storage devices, attaining fast data durability for concurrent file writes is demanding to high-performance storage systems
in cluster systems. We approach the challenge by proposing a
system that uses a small amount of fast persistent memory for
buffering concurrent file writes while preserving data durability.
The main issue in designing a durable file buffer is allowing
concurrent file writes to store data in a shared and limited
space of persistent memory without incurring lock or resource
contention. This paper addresses such issue and presents AUTOBAHN, a durable file buffer that expedites file I/O operations.
