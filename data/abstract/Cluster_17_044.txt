
Almost all performance analysis tools in the HPC
space perform some form of aggregation to compute summary
information of a series of performance measurements, from summations to more complex operations like histograms. Aggregation
not only reduces data volumes and consequently storage space
requirements and overheads, but is also crucial to extract insights
from recorded measurement data. In current tools, however,
most aspects that control the aggregation, such as the data
dimensions to be reduced, are hard-coded in the tool for a set of
particular use cases identified by the tool developer and cannot
be extended or modified by the user. This limits their flexibility
and often results in users having to learn and use multiple tools
with different aggregation options for their performance analysis
needs.

We present a novel approach for performance data aggregation
based on a flexible key:value data model with user-defined
attributes, where users can define custom aggregation schemes
in a simple description language. This not only gives users the
control to deploy the particular data aggregation they need,
but also opens the door for aggregations along applicationspecific data dimensions that cannot be achieved with traditional
profiling tools. We show how our approach can be applied for
performance profiling at runtime, cross-process data aggregation,
and interactive data analysis and demonstrate its functionality
with several case studies driven by real world codes.
