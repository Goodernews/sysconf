networks with unknown topology and without collision detection mechanisms. It has been known for almost 20 years that in
undirected networks with n nodes and diameter D, randomized
broadcasting requires Q(D log # + log? n) rounds in expectation,
assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to communicate (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and
Wajc (PODC’2016) showed that this bound can be slightly improved for the model with spontaneous transmissions, providing an

o(D Ser weret + log) n)-time broadcasting algorithm. In this

paper, we give a new and faster algorithm that completes broadcasting in ows + log) n) time, with high probability. This yields
the first optimal O(D)-time broadcasting algorithm whenever D is
polynomial in n.

Furthermore, our approach can be applied to design a new leader
election algorithm that matches the performance of our broadcasting algorithm. Previously, all fast randomized leader election algorithms have been using broadcasting as their subroutine and their
complexity have been asymptotically strictly bigger than the complexity of broadcasting. In particular, the fastest previously known
randomized leader election algorithm of Ghaffari and Haeupler
(SODA’2013) requires O(D log #§ min {log log n, log $}+ log n)time with high probability. Our new algorithm requires O(D 2 5 +
log? n) time with high probability, and it achieves the optimal
O(D) time whenever D is polynomial in n.
