
Heterogeneous compute nodes have become an integral component of todayâ€™s HPC systems. Recent research has
established the importance of data layout and placement on such
systems. This paper explores the power and energy aspects of
data layout and placement on heterogeneous systems. We present
results of an experimental study that evaluates the impact of data
layout and placement on candidate HPC node architectures for
kernels that exhibit a wide variety of performance characteristics.
The results of the study show that data layout and placement can have a significant impact on the energy efficiency
of heterogeneous applications. On some platforms, selecting
the appropriate layout can yield up to an order-of-magnitude
improvement in energy efficiency. The study shows that the
conventional approach of using a structure-of-arrays for devicemapped data structures is not always profitable and that in
addition to memory divergence, data layout choices are impacted
by a variety of factors including arithmetic intensity and task
granularity. The results of the study are used to establish a set
of energy imperatives to guide data layout and placement across
different architectures.
