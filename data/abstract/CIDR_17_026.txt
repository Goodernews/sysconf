
Existing scale-up graph engines are tuned for either short,
navigational requests (e.g., Nearest-Neighbor) or longer, analytics requests (e.g., PageRank). However, they do not
have good performance for both workloads running concurrently. We present Janus, a scale-up graph engine architected for modern, many-core servers with large memory.
Janus has excellent scale-up performance on navigational requests, on analytics requests, and on a mixed workload running concurrently both navigational and analytics requests.
