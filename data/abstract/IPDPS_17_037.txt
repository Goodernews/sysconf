
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures are widely used in mainstream multi-socket computer
systems to scale memory bandwidth. Without a NUMA-aware
design, programs can suffer from significant performance degradation due to inter-socket bandwidth contention. However, identifying bandwidth contention is challenging. Existing methods
measure bandwidth consumption. However, consumption alone
is insufficient to quantify bandwidth contention. Furthermore,
existing methods diagnose bandwidth for the entire program execution, but lack the ability to associate bandwidth performance
to the source code and data structures involved. To address these
challenges, we propose DR-BW, a new tool based on machine
learning to identify bandwidth contention in NUMA architectures
and provide optimization guidance. DR-BW first trains a set
of micro benchmarks and extracts useful features to identify
bandwidth contention via a supervised machine learning model.
Our experiments show that DR-BW achieves more than 96%
accuracy. Second, DR-BW associates memory accesses that incur
bandwidth contention with data objects, which provides intuitive
guidance for optimization. Third, we apply DR-BW to a number
of real benchmarks. Our optimization based on the insights
obtained from DR-BW yields up to a 6.5x speedup in modern
NUMA architectures.
