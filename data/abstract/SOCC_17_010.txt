cloud. CapNeET allows fine-grained management of rights, recursive delegation, hierarchical policies, and least privilege. To enable
secure collaboration, CAPNET extends a classical capability model
with support for decentralized authority. We implement CAPNET
in the substrate of a software-defined network, integrate it with
the OpenStack cloud, and develop protocols enabling secure multiparty collaboration.
