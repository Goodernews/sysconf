
In this paper, we design and develop R��, a novel battery-free touch
sensing user interface (UI) primitive for future IoT and smart spaces.
R�� enables UIs to be constructed using o�-the-shelf RFID readers
and tags, and provides a unique approach to designing smart IoT
spaces. With R��, any surface can be turned into a touch-aware
surface by simply attaching RFID tags to them. R�� also supports
custom-designed RFID tags, and thus allows specially customized
UIs to be easily deployed into a real-world environment.
R�� is built using the technique of impedance tracking: when a
human �nger touches the surface of an RFID tag, the impedance
of the antenna changes. This change manifests as a change in the
phase of the RFID backscattered signal, and is used by R�� to track
�ne-grained touch movement over both o�-the-shelf and custombuilt tags. We study this impedance behavior in-depth and show
how R�� is a reliable UI primitive that is robust even within a multitag environment. We leverage this primitive to build a prototype of
R�� that can continuously locate a �nger during a swipe movement
to within 3mm of its actual position. We also show how customdesign RFID tags can be built and used with R��, and provide two
example applications that demonstrate its real-world use.
