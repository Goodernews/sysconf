
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the main protocol
used to secure Internet traffic and cloud computing. It relies on
the computation-intensive RSA cryptography, which primarily
limits the throughput of the handshake process. In this paper, we
design and implement an OpenSSL library, termed PhiOpenSSL,
which targets the Intel Xeon Phi (KNC) coprocessor, and utilizes
Intel Phiâ€™s SIMD and multi-threading capability to reduce the
SSL computation latency. In particular, PhiOpenSSL vectorizes
all big integer multiplications and Montgomery operations involved in RSA calculations and employs the Chinese Remainder
Theorem and fixed-window exponentiation in its customized
library. In an experiment involving the computation of Montgomery exponentiation, PhiOpenSSL was as much as 15.3 times
faster than the two other reference libcrypto libraries, one
from the Intel Many-core Platform Software Stack (MPSS) and
the other from the default OpenSSL. Our RSA private key
cryptography routines in PhiOpenSSL are 1.6-5.7 times faster
than those in these two reference systems.
