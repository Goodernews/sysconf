
We introduce a replay tool that can be used to replay captured I/O workloads for performance evaluation of highperformance storage systems. We study several sources
in the stock operating system that introduce the uncertainty of replaying a workload. Based on the remedies of
these findings, we design and develop a new replay tool
called hfplayer that can more accurately replay intensive
block I/O workloads in a similar unscaled environment.
However, to replay a given workload trace in a scaled
environment, the dependency between I/O requests becomes crucial. Therefore, we propose a heuristic way of
speculating I/O dependencies in a block I/O trace. Using
the generated dependency graph, hfplayer is capable of
replaying the I/O workload in a scaled environment. We
evaluate hfplayer with a wide range of workloads using
several accuracy metrics and find that it produces better
accuracy when compared with two exiting available replay tools.
