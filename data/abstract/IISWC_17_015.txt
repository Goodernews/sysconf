especially for its potential in improving power, performance,
and scalability of a computing system. However, prior work
heavily relies upon a programmer to identify code sections
where various approximation techniques can be applied. Such
an approach is error prone and cannot scale well beyond small
applications. In this paper, we contribute with a tool, called
Approximeter, to automatically identify and quantify code sections where approximation can be used and to what extant. The
tool works by first identifying potential approximable functions
and then, injecting errors at appropriate locations. The tool
runs Monte Carlo experiments to quantify statistical relation
between injected error and corresponding output accuracy. The
tool also provides a rough estimate of potential performance
gain from approximating a certain function. Finally, it ranks
the approximable functions based on their error tolerance and
performance gain.
