
Many situations in the security domain require decisionmaking based on complex data, i.e., many variables which
need to be taken into account before adequate decisions can
be made. For example, in a surveillance scenario, the size
and complexity of the area of interest, the mix of objects,
and the unexpected behavior of suspects are just a few examples of complex variables to be analyzed in the process.
Existing decision support systems provide some analysis,
but are typically limited in the complexity they can handle. Therefore, users end up with simplified models which
often suffer in the accuracy of their decisions and, ultimately,
may lead to incorrect decisions. In this work, we present a
framework that can scale to cope with the complexity and
time requirements of real-world scenarios, while remaining
flexible to handle the ad-hoc adaptation to the situation.
We discuss the challenges and solutions for such a scalable
and flexible system, and validate it using a target tracking
scenario in urban environments of different sizes.
