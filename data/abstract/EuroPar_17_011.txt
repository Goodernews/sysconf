
. We propose a novel parallel approach to compute the sparse
matrix-vector product (SPMV) on graphics processing units (GPUs),
optimized for matrices with an irregular row distribution of the non-zero
entries. Our algorithm relies on the standard CSR format to store the
sparse matrix, requires an inexpensive pre-processing step, and consumes
only a minor amount of additional memory compared with significantly
more expensive GPU-specific sparse matrix layouts. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic to determine whether our method or the standard
CSR SPMV algorithm should be used for a specific matrix. As a result,
our proposal, combined with the standard CSR SPMV, can be adopted
as the default choice for the implementation of SPMV in general-purpose
sparse linear algebra libraries for GPUs.
