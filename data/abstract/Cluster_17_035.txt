
Various extensions of TCP/IP have been proposed
to reduce network latency; examples include Explicit Congestion
Notification CECN), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) and several
proposals for Active Queue Management (AQM). Combining
these techniques requires adjusting various parameters, and
recent studies have found that it is difficult to do so while obtaining both high performance and low latency. This is especially
true for mixed use data centres that host both latency-sensitive
applications and high-throughput workloads such as Hadoop.

This paper studies the difficulty in configuration, and characterises the problem as related to ACK packets. Such packets cannot be set as ECN Capable Transport (ECT), with
the consequence that a disproportionate number of them are
dropped. We explain how this behavior decreases throughput,
and propose a small change to the way that non-ECT-capable
packets are handled in the network switches. We demonstrate
robust performance for modified AQMs on a Hadoop cluster,
maintaining full throughput while reducing latency by 85%. We
also demonstrate that commodity switches with shallow buffers
are able to reach the same throughput as deeper buffer switches.
Finally, we explain how both TCP-ECN and DCTCP can achieve
the best performance using a simple marking scheme, in constrast
to the current preference for relying on AQMs to mark packets.
