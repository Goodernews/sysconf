
Virtualization of computing and communication infrastructures were disseminated as possible solutions for networks evolution and deployment of new services on cloud
data centers. Although promising, their effective application
faces obstacles, mainly caused by rigidity on the management
of communication resources. Currently, the Software-Defined
Networks (SDN) paradigm has been popularizing customization and flexibility in network management due to separation
of control and data planes. However, benefits introduced by
SDN are not trivially applied to Virtual Infrastructures (VIs)
provisioning on SDN-based cloud providers. An allocation
mechanism needs joint information of control and data planes
in order to deliver Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware mappings
while achieving provider objectives. In this work, we formulate
the online VI allocation on SDN-based cloud data centers as a
Mixed Integer Program (MIP). Following, integer constraints
are relaxed to obtain a linear program, and rounding techniques are applied. The mechanism performs VI allocation considering latency, bandwidth, and virtual machine requirements.
The results indicate that the VIs mean internal latency can be
reduced while simultaneously enforcing other QoS constraints.
