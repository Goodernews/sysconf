
Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) is a new technique
for increasing areal data density in hard drives. Drivemanaged SMR (DM-SMR) drives employ a shingled
translation layer to mask internal data management and
support block interface to the host software. Two major challenges of designing an efficient shingled translation layer for DM-SMR drives are metadata overhead
and garbage collection overhead.

In this paper we introduce SMaRT, an approach to
Shingled Magnetic Recording Translation which adapts
its data management scheme as the drive utilization
changes. SMaRT uses a hybrid update strategy which
performs in-place update for the qualified tracks and outof-place updates for the unqualified tracks. Background
Garbage Collection (GC) operations and on-demand GC
operations are used when the free space becomes too
fragmented. SMaRT also has a specially crafted space
allocation and track migration scheme that supports automatic cold data progression to minimize GC overhead
in the long term.

We implement SMaRT and compare it with a regular Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and a simulated Seagate
DM-SMR drive. The experiments with several block
I/O traces demonstrate that SMaRT performs better than
the Seagate drive and even provides comparable performance as regular HDDs when drive space usage is below
a certain threshold.
