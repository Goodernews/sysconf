in cloud computing systems can provide timely queried results with acceptable accuracy, thus alleviating the consumption of a large amount of resources. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is able to maintain the data locality and support
approximate queries. However, due to randomly choosing
hash functions, LSH has to use too many functions to guarantee the query accuracy. The extra computation and storage overheads exacerbate the real performance of LSH. In
order to reduce the overheads and deliver high performance,
we propose a distribution-aware scheme, called DLSH, to offer cost-effective approximate nearest neighbor query service
for cloud computing. The idea of DLSH is to leverage the
principal components of the data distribution as the projection vectors of hash functions in LSH, further quantify the
weight of each hash function and adjust the interval value in
each hash table. We then refine the queried result set based
on the hit frequency to significantly decrease the time overhead of distance computation. Extensive experiments in a
large-scale cloud computing testbed demonstrate significant
improvements in terms of multiple system performance mettics. We have released the source code of DLSH for public
use.
