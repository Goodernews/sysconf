
Among the low-diameter, high-radix networks being
deployed in next-generation HPC systems, dual-rail fat-tree
networks are a promising approach. Adding additional injection
connections (rails) to one or more network planes allows multirail fat-tree networks to alleviate communication bottlenecks.
These multi-rail networks necessitate new design considerations,
such as routing choices, job placements, and scalability of rails.
We extend our fat-tree network model in the CODES parallel
simulation framework to support multi-rail and multi-plane
configurations in addition to different types of static routing,
resulting in a powerful research vehicle for fat-tree network analysis. Our detailed packet-level simulations use communication
traces from real applications to make performance predictions
and to evaluate the impact of single- and multi-rail networks in
conjunction with schemes for injection rail selection and intraplane routing.
