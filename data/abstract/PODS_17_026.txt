as, users publishing tweets and other users retweeting them, friends
posting photos and others liking them or even authors publishing research papers and others citing these publications. A wellaccepted notion of “impact” for users in these settings is the HIndex, which is the largest k such that at least k publications have
k or more (positive) feedback.

We study how to calculate H-index on large streams of user publications and feedback. If all the items can be stored, H-index of a
user can be computed by sorting. We focus on the streaming setting
where as is typical, we do not have space to store all the items.

We present the first known streaming algorithm for computing
the H-index of a user in the cash register streaming model using
space poly(1/e, log(1/8), log n); this algorithm provides an additive e approximation. For the aggregated model where feedback for
a publication is collated, we present streaming algorithms that use
much less space, either only dependent on € and even a small constant. We also address the problem of finding “heavy hitters” users
in H-index without estimating everyones’ H-index. We present
randomized streaming algorithms for finding 1 + € approximation
to heavy hitters that uses space poly(1/e, log(1/5), log n) and succeeds with probability at least 1 — 5. Again, this is the first sublinear space algorithm for this problem, despite extensive research
on heavy hitters in general. Our work initiates study of streaming
algorithms for problems that estimate impact or identify impactful
users.
