
Computer architects use a variety of workloads to
measure system performance. For many workloads, the workload
configuration determines the stress applied to the system and
the corresponding performance behavior. Therefore, architects
must make great efforts to explore and find the correct workload
configuration before performing detailed analysis.

However, such explorations become impossible for indevelopment systems which exist only as a software model. The
existing system modeling platforms are either accurate but too
slow, or fast but inaccurate to get workload-reported performance
metrics (e.g., latency and throughput) which are necessary for
configuring workloads.

In this paper, we propose SÃ©ressRight, a method to quickly
model the first-order performance of full-system workloads and
reconstruct the workload-reported performance metrics. StressRight allows to explore how the workload configurations affect
the stress and performance. The key idea is to execute workloads
on a fast but timing-agnostic platform (e.g. emulators), and efficiently reconstruct the timing/performance details by analyzing
only the unique code blocks. Our evaluation using memcached
and PARSEC shows that StressRight achieves 8~45x speedup
compared to a cycle-level simulator while maintaining good
accuracy.
