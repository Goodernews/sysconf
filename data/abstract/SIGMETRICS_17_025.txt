
The modern world is becoming increasingly dependent on computing and communication technology to function, but
unfortunately its application and impact on areas such as critical infrastructure and industrial control system (ICS) networks
remains to be thoroughly studied. Significant research has been conducted to address the myriad security concerns in these
areas, but they are virtually all based on artificial testbeds or simulations designed on assumptions about their behavior either
from knowledge of traditional IT networking or from basic principles of ICS operation. In this work, we provide the most
detailed characterization of an example ICS to date in order to determine if these common assumptions hold true. A live
power distribution substation is observed over the course of two and a half years to measure its behavior and evolution over
time. Then, a horizontal study is conducted that compared this behavior with three other substations from the same company.
Although most predictions were found to be correct, some unexpected behavior was observed that highlights the fundamental
differences between ICS and IT networks including round trip times dominated by processing speed as opposed to network
delay, several well known TCP features being largely irrelevant, and surprisingly large jitter from devices running real-time
operating systems. The impact of these observations is discussed in terms of generality to other embedded networks, network
security applications, and the suitability of the TCP protocol for this environment.
