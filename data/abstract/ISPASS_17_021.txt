
Accurate IPC estimates are critical for generating
performance projections of key workloads on future designs.
However, the need to respond to projections requests in a
timely manner in the face of rapidly evolving applications and
software stacks and tight schedule constraints, often preclude
design teams from executing detailed workload analysis, sampling and simulation flows for such purposes.

We address this problem by taking advantage of the large
amount of data that performance modeling teams commonly
generate as part of architectural studies across thousands of
workload scenarios. We propose two methods for exploiting
these datasets: one that builds proxy suites, and another that
builds decision-tree based classifiers. Both methods can generate IPC estimates for a target workload without collecting new
workload samples, or running a single additional simulation.
We discuss our experience using these techniques to estimate
the IPC of numerous commercial workloads on four industrial
x86 processor designs. The resulting IPC estimates were on
average, within 2% of those obtained via measurements or
detailed cycle-accurate simulations Importantly, using these
methods, we were able to generate IPC estimates for a target
workload in a matter of hours to 1-2 days, compared to several
weeks using conventional approaches.
