and industrial IoT systems require a service for ultrafast state externalization to become cloud-native. In this
paper we propose a distributed shared memory system,
called DAL, which achieves the lowest possible latency
by transparently co-locating individual data items with
applications working on them. Upon changes in data access patterns, the system automatically adapts data locations to keep the number of remote operations at a minimum. By avoiding the costs of network transport and
using shared memory communication, the system can
achieve 1 ps data access latency. We envision DAL as a
platform component which enables latency-sensitive applications to take advantage of the cloud.
