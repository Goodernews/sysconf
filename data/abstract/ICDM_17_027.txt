
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a
traumatic-stressor related disorder developed by exposure to a
traumatic or adverse environmental event that caused serious
harm or injury. Structured interview is the only widely accepted
clinical practice for PTSD diagnosis but suffers from several
limitations including the stigma associated with the disease.
Diagnosis of PTSD patients by analyzing speech signals has
been investigated as an alternative since recent years, where
speech signals are processed to extract frequency features and
these features are then fed into a classification model for PTSD
diagnosis. In this paper, we developed a deep belief network
(DBN) model combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy
for PTSD diagnosis. We computed three categories of speech
features and utilized the DBN model to fuse these features. The
TL strategy was utilized to transfer knowledge learned from a
large speech recognition database, TIMIT, for PTSD detection
where PTSD patient data is difficult to collect. We evaluated the
proposed methods on two PTSD speech databases, each of which
consists of audio recordings from 26 patients. We compared the
proposed methods with other popular methods and showed that
the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier only
achieved an accuracy of 57.68%, and TL strategy boosted the
performance of the DBN from 61.53% to 74.99%. Altogether,
our method provides a pragmatic and promising tool for PTSD
diagnosis.
