
Live Virtual Machine (VM) migration offers a couple of benefits to cloud providers and users, but it is limited within
a data center. With the development of cloud computing and
the cooperation between data centers, live VM migration is also
desired across data centers. Based on a detailed analysis of VM
deployment models and the nature of VM image data, we design
and implement a new migration framework called CBase. The
key concept of CBase is a newly introduced central base image
repository for reliable and efficient data sharing between VMs
and data centers. With this central base image repository, live
VM migration and further performance optimizations are made
possible. The results from an extensive experiment show that
CBase is able to support VM migration efficiently, outperforming
existing solutions in terms of total migration time and network
traffic.
