We present a randomized distributed algorithm that computes a
minimum spanning tree in Tmix(G) - 20 Viog 7 log log ")) rounds, in
any n-node graph G with mixing time tpix(G). This result provides
a sub-polynomial complexity for a wide range of graphs of practical
interest, and goes below the celebrated O(D + Vn) lower bound
of Das Sarma et al. [STOCâ€™11] which holds for some worst-case
general graphs.

The core novelty in this result is a distributed method for permutation routing. In this problem, one is given a number of sourcedestination pairs, and we should deliver one packet from each
source to its destination, all in parallel, in the shortest span of time
possible. Our algorithm allows us to route and deliver all these
packets in tmix(G) - 206 Viog mloglog 2) rounds, assuming that each
node v is the source or destination for at most dg(v) packets. The
main technical ingredient in this routing result is a certain hierarchical embedding of good-expansion random graphs on the base
graph, which we believe can be of interest well beyond this work.
