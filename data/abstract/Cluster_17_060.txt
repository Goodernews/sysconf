
Traditional machine learning algorithms often require computations on centralized data, but modern datasets are
collected and stored in a distributed way. In addition to the cost of
moving data to centralized locations, increasing concerns about
privacy and security warrant distributed approaches. We propose
keybin, a distributed key-based binning clustering algorithm
for high-dimensional spaces. keybin locally generates a spatial
key for each data point across all dimensions without needing
knowledge of other data. Then, it performs a conceptual MapReduce procedure in the index space to form a global clustering
assignment. We present an implementation and a case study on
the capabilities and limitations of this approach, showing that
this algorithm can learn a global clustering structure with limited
communication and can scale with the dimensionality and size
of data sets.
