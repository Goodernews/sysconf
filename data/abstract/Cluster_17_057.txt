
High performance computing systems will need to
operate with certain power budgets while maximizing performance in the exascale era. Such systems are built with power
aware components, whose collective peak power may exceed the
specified power budget. Cluster level power bounded computing
addresses this power challenge by coordinating power among
components within compute nodes and further adjusting the
number of participating nodes. It offers more space to increase
system performance by utilizing the available power budget more
efficiently within and across the nodes.

In this paper, we present the design of a hierarchical multidimensional power aware allocation framework, CLIP, for power
bounded parallel computing on multicore-based computer clusters. The framework satisfies the specified power bound by
managing the power distribution among nodes at the cluster
level, and among sockets, cores and NUMA memory modules
at the node level. The power allocation is enforced with multiple complementary power management techniques, including
memory power level setting, thread concurrency throttling, and
core-thread affinity. We present an application characterization
method based on applications’ scalability and an associated
performance model, which can accurately determine the optimal
number of participating compute nodes and components, and
their power distribution for given applications. Experimental
results on a Haswell-based computer cluster show that the
proposed scheduler outperforms compared methods by over 20%
on average for various power budgets.
