due to the elasticity of cloud resources and their on-demand nature. However, support for deploying application components with strict deadlines
on their deployment is lacking in current cloud providers. This is particularly important for adaptive applications that must automatically and
seamlessly scale, migrate, or recover swiftly from failures. A common
deployment procedure is to transmit application packages from the application provider to the cloud, and install the application there. Thus, users
need to manually deploy their applications into clouds step by step with
no guarantee regarding deadlines. In this work, we propose a Deadlineaware Deployment System (DDS) for time critical applications in clouds.
DDS enables users to automatically deploy applications into clouds. We
design bandwidth-aware EDF scheduling algorithms in DDS that minimize the number of deployments that miss their deadlines and maximize
the utilization of network bandwidth. In the evaluation, we show that
DDS leverages network bandwidth sufficiently, and significantly reduces
the number of missed deadlines during deployment.
