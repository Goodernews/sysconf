
 Today, there is a steep rise in the amount of data
being collected from diverse applications. Consequently, data
analytic workloads are gaining popularity to gain insight that
can benefit the application, e.g., financial trading, social media
analysis. To study the architectural behavior of the workloads,
architectural simulation is one of the most common approaches.
However, because of the long-running nature of the workloads,
it is not trivial to identify which parts of the analysis to simulate.

In the current work, we introduce SimProf, a sampling
framework for data analytic workloads. Using this tool, we are
able to select representative simulation points based on the phase
behavior of the analysis at a method level granularity. This
provides a better understanding of the simulation point and
also reduces the simulation time for different input sets. We
present the framework for Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
frameworks, which can be easily extended to other data analytic
workloads.
