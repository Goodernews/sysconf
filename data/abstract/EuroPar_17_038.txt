
. The scalability of sparse matrix-vector multiplication
(SpMV) on distributed memory systems depends on multiple factors
that involve different communication cost metrics. The irregular sparsity
pattern of the coefficient matrix manifests itself as high bandwidth (total
and/or maximum volume) and/or high latency (total and/or maximum
message count) overhead. In this work, we propose a hypergraph partitioning model which combines two earlier models for one-dimensional
partitioning, one addressing total and maximum volume, and the other
one addressing total volume and total message count. Our model relies
on the recursive bipartitioning paradigm and simultaneously addresses
three cost metrics in a single partitioning phase in order to reduce volume
and latency overheads. We demonstrate the validity of our model on a
large dataset that contains more than 300 matrices. The results indicate
that compared to the earlier models, our model significantly improves
the scalability of SpMV.
