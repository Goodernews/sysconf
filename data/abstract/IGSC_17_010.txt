
Advanced power measurement capabilities are becoming available on large scale High Performance Computing
(HPC) deployments. There exist several approaches to providing
power measurements today, primarily through in-band (e.g.
RAPL) and out-of-band measurements (e.g. power meters). Both
types of measurement can be augmented with application-level
profiling, however it can be difficult to assess the type and detail
of measurement needed to obtain insight from the application
power profile. This paper presents a taxonomy for classifying
power profiling techniques on modern HPC platforms. Three
HPC mini-applications are analyzed across three production HPC
systems to examine the level of detail, scope, and complexity
of these power profiles. We demonstrate that a combination
of out-of-band measurement with in-band application region
profiling can provide an accurate, detailed view of power usage
without introducing overhead. This work also provides a set of
recommendations for how to best profile HPC workloads.
