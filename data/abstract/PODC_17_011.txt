In this paper we initiate the study of property testing in multi-party
communication complexity, focusing on testing triangle-freeness
in graphs. We consider the coordinator model, where we have k
players receiving private inputs, and a coordinator who receives
no input; the coordinator can communicate with all the players,
but the players cannot communicate with each other. In this model,
we ask: if an input graph is divided between the players, with each
player receiving some of the edges, how many bits do the players
and the coordinator need to exchange to determine if the graph is
triangle-free, or far from triangle-free? We are especially interested
in simultaneous communication protocols, where there is only one
communication round.

For general communication protocols, we show that O(k(nd)!/ 44
kâ€™) bits are sufficient to test triangle-freeness in graphs of size n
with average degree d. We also give a simultaneous protocol using
O(k-n) bits when d = O(-yn) and O(k(nd)!/3) when d = Q(n). We
show that for average degree d = O(1), our simultaneous protocol
is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors. For higher
degrees, we are not able to give lower bounds on testing trianglefreeness, but we give evidence that the problem is hard by showing
that finding an edge that participates in a triangle is hard, even
when promised that the graph is far from triangle-free.
