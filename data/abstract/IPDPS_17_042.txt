networks (DCN) to increase transmission throughput. However,
the small flows, which take a large fraction of data center
traffic, will easily get a timeout when split onto multiple paths.
Moreover, the dynamic congestions and node failures in DCN
will exacerbate the reorder problem of parallel multi-path
transmissions for large flows. In this paper, we propose DC?MTCP (Data Center Coded Multi-path TCP), which employs
a fast and light-weight coding method to address the above
challenges while maintaining the benefit of parallel multi-path
transmissions. To meet the high flow performance in DCN, we
insert a very low ratio of coded packets with a careful selection
of the packets to be coded. We further present a progressive
decoding algorithm to decode the packets online with a low
time complexity. Extensive ns2-based simulations show that
with two orders of magnitude lower coding delay, DC?-MTCP
can reduce on average 40% flow completion time for small flows
and increase 30% flow throughput for large flows compared
to the peer schemes in varying network conditions.
