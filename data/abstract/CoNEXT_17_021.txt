hot topic investigated for over a decade. However, most of the
research efforts in this area assume the intensity of the light emitted
from LEDs is constant. This is not true any more when Smart
Lighting is introduced to VLC in recent years, which requires the
LEDs to adapt their brightness according to the intensity of the
natural ambient light. Smart lighting saves power consumption
and improves user comfort. However, intensity adaptation severely
affects the throughput performance of the data communication. In
this paper, we propose SmartVLC, a system that can maximize the
throughput (benefit communication) while still maintaining the
LEDsâ€™ illumination function (benefit smart lighting). A new adaptive
multiple pulse position modulation scheme is proposed to support
fine-grained dimming levels to avoid flickering and at the same time,
maximize the throughput under each dimming level. SmartVLC is
implemented on low-cost commodity hardware and several real-life
challenges in both hardware and software are addressed to make
SmartVLC a robust realtime system. Comprehensive experiments
are carried out to evaluate the performance of SmartVLC under
multifaceted scenarios. The results demonstrate that SmartVLC
supports a communication distance up to 3.6m, and improves the
throughput achieved with two state-of-the-art approaches by 40%
and 12% on average, respectively, without bringing any flickering
to users.
