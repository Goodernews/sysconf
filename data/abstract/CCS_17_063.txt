of operation are the level of security achieved (chosen-plaintext
security, authenticated encryption, nonce-misuse resistance, and
so on) and performance. When measuring the security level of a
mode of operation, it does not suffice to consider asymptotics, and
a concrete analysis is necessary. This is especially the case today,
when encryption rates can be very high, and so birthday bounds
may be approached or even reached.

In this paper, we show that key-derivation at every encryption significantly improves the security bounds in many cases. We
present a new key-derivation method that utilizes a truncated block
cipher, and show that this is far better than standard block-cipher
based key derivation. We prove that by using our key derivation
method, we obtain greatly improved bounds for many modes of
operation, with a result that the lifetime of a key can be significantly
extended. We demonstrate this for AES-CTR (CPA-security), AESGCM (authenticated encryption) and AES-GCM-SIV (nonce-misuse
resistance). Finally, we demonstrate that when using modern hardware with AES instructions (AES-NI), the performance penalty of
deriving keys at each encryption is insignificant for most uses.
