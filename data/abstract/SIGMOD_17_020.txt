database management systems (DBMSs). Beyond block-level
compression of individual database pages or operation log (oplog)
messages, as used in today’s DBMSs, dbDedup uses byte-level
delta encoding of individual records within the database to achieve
greater savings. dbDedup’s single-pass encoding method can be
integrated into the storage and logging components of a DBMS
to provide two benefits: (1) reduced size of data stored on disk
beyond what traditional compression schemes provide, and (2) reduced amount of data transmitted over the network for replication
services. To evaluate our work, we implemented dbDedup in a distributed NoSQL DBMS and analyzed its properties using four real
datasets. Our results show that dbDedup achieves up to 37× reduction in the storage size and replication traffic of the database on its
own and up to 61× reduction when paired with the DBMS’s blocklevel compression. dbDedup provides both benefits with negligible
effect on DBMS throughput or client latency (average and tail).
