
Stencil computations represent a very common class of nested loops
in scientific and engineering applications. The exhaustively studied
tiling is one of the most powerful transformation techniques to
explore the data locality and parallelism. Unlike previous work,
which mostly blocks the iteration space of a stencil directly, this
paper proposes a novel two-level tessellation scheme. A set of blocks
are designed to tessellate the spatial space in various ways. The
blocks can be processed in parallel without redundant computation.
This corresponds to extending them along the time dimension and
can form a tessellation of the iteration space. Experimental results
show that our code performs up to 12% better than the existing
highly concurrent schemes for the 3d27p stencil.
