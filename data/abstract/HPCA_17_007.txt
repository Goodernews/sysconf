
Todayâ€™s caches tightly couple data with metadata
(Address Tags) at the cache line granularity. The co-location of
data and its identifying metadata means that they require multiple approaches to locate data (associative way searches and
level-by-level searches), evict data (coherent writebacks buffers
and associative level-by-level searches) and keep data coherent
(directory indirections and associative level-by-level searches).
This results in complex implementations with many corner
cases, increased latency and energy, and limited flexibility for
data optimizations.

We propose splitting the metadata and data into two separate
structures: a metadata hierarchy and a data hierarchy. The
metadata hierarchy tracks the location of the data in the
data hierarchy. This allows us to easily apply many different
optimizations to the data hierarchy, including smart data
placement, dynamic coherence, and direct accesses.

The new split cache hierarchy, Direct-to-Master (D2M),
provides a unified mechanism for cache searching, eviction,
and coherence, that eliminates level-by-level data movement
and searches, associative cache address tags comparisons and
about 90% of the indirections through a central directory.
Optimizations such as moving LLC slices to the near-side of
the network and private/shared data classification can easily
be built on top off D2M to further improve its efficiency. This
approach delivers a 54% improvement in cache hierarchy EDP
ys. a mobile processor and 40% vs. a server processor, reduces
network traffic by an average of 70%, reduces the L1 miss
latency by 30% and is especially effective for workloads with
high cache pressure.
