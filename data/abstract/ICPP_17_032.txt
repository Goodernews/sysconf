
In this paper, we study the link scheduling problem
considering the fluctuating fading effect in transmissions. We
extend the previous deterministic physical interference model
to the Rayleigh-fading model that uses the stochastic propagation to address fading effects. Based on this model, we
formulate a problem called Fading-Resistant Link Scheduling
(Fading-R-LS) problem, which aims to maximize the throughput of all links in a single time slot. We prove that this problem
is NP-hard. Based on the geometric structure of Fading-R-LS,
we then propose two centralized schemes with O(g(L)) and
O(1) performance guarantee, respectively, where g(L) is the
number of magnitudes of transmission link lengths. We further
propose a distributed scheme based on game theory, which has
O(A“®) performance guarantee, where A is the ratio between
the maximum and the minimum distances between nodes, and
a: is the path loss exponent. Our experimental results show that
the superior performance of our proposed schemes compared
to a previous scheme.
