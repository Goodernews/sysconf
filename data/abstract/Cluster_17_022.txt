
Data reduction through compression is emerging
as a promising approach to ease I/O costs for simulation codes
on supercomputers. Typically, this compression is achieved by
techniques that operate on individual time slices. However, as
simulation codes advance in time, outputting multiple time
slices as they go, the opportunity for compression incorporating
the time dimension has not been extensively explored. Moreover, recent supercomputers are increasingly equipped with
deeper memory hierarchies, including solid state drives and
burst buffers, which creates the opportunity to temporarily
store multiple time slices and then apply compression to
them all at once, i.e., spatiotemporal compression. This paper
explores the benefits of incorporating the time dimension into
existing wavelet compression, including studying its key parameters and demonstrating its benefits in three axes: storage,
accuracy, and temporal resolution. Our results demonstrate
that temporal compression can improve each of these axes,
and that the impact on performance for real systems, including
tradeoffs in memory usage and execution time, is acceptable.
We also demonstrate the benefits of spatiotemporal wavelet
compression with real-world visualization use cases and tailored evaluation metrics.
