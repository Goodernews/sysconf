wide range of applications such as detection of cyber-communities
in social networks, recommendations based on the interest group,
and estimating hidden features in a social network. In distributed
frameworks, the primary focus has been scalability. However,
the accuracy of the algorithmâ€™s output is also critical. We
propose the first distributed community detection algorithm based
on the state-of-the-art CEIL scoring function. Our algorithm,
named DCEIL, is fast, scalable and maintains the quality
of communities. DCEIL outperforms the existing state-of-theart distributed Louvain algorithm by 180% on an average in
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) Index and 6.61% on an
average in Jaccard Index metrics. DCEIL completes execution
for 1 billion edges within 112 minutes and outperforms state-ofthe-art distributed Louvain algorithm by 4.3x. DCEIL critically
exploits three novel heuristics which address the existing issues
with distributed community detection algorithms that have the
hierarchical structure of CEIL or Louvain methods. Further,
our proposed heuristics are generic as well as efficient, and we
illustrate their efficacy by enhancing the accuracy of distributed
Louvain algorithm by 22.91% on an average in Jaccard Index,
and the average execution time by 1.68 over popular datasets.
