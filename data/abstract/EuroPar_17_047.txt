
. Fault tolerance becomes an important feature at large computer systems where the mean time between failure decreases. Checkpointing is a method often used to provide resilience. We present an
in-memory checkpointing library based on a PGAS API implemented
with GASPI/GPI. It offers a substantial benefit when recovering from
failure and leverages existing fault tolerance features of GASPI/GPI.
The overhead of the library is negligible when testing it with a simple
stencil code and a real life seismic imaging method.
