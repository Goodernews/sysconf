choosing the appropriate position to place cloudlet is very important for reducing the user’s access delay. For service provider, it is
always very costly to deployment cloudlets. How many cloudlets
should be placed in a WMAN and how much resource each
cloudlet should have is very important for the service provider.
In this paper, we study the cloudlet placement and resource
allocation problem in a large-scale Wireless WMAN, we formulate
the problem as an novel cloudlet placement problem that given
an average access delay between mobile users and the cloudlets,
place K cloudlets to some strategic locations in the WMAN with
the objective to minimize the number of use cloudlet K. We
then propose an exact solution to the problem by formulating
it as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Due to the poor
scalability of the ILP, we devise a clustering algorithm K-Medoids
(KM) for the problem. For a special case of the problem where
all cloudlets computing capabilities have been given, we propose
an efficient heuristic for it. We finally evaluate the performance
of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations.
Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed algorithms are
effective.
