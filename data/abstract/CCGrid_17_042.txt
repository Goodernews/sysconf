application deployment technologies are enabling opportunities
for realizing highly customized software-defined environments,
which can support dynamic and data-driven applications.
However, this requires rethinking traditional resource federation models to support dynamic resource compositions, which
can adapt to evolving application needs and the dynamic
state of underlying resources. In this paper, we present a
programmable approach that leverages software-defined techniques to create a dynamic space-time infrastructure service
composition. We propose the use of Constraint Programming
as a formal language to allow users, applications, and service
providers to define the desired state of the execution environment. The resulting distributed software-defined environment
continually adapts to meet objectives/constraints set by the
users, applications, and/or resource providers. We present
the design and prototype implementation of such distributed
software-defined environment. We use a cancer informatics
workflow to demonstrate the operation of our framework
using resources from five different cloud providers, which are
aggregated on-demand based on dynamic user and resource
provider constraints.
