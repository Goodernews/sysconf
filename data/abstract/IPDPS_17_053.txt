
Stencil computation arises from a broad set of
scientific and engineering applications and often plays a critical
role in the performance of extreme-scale simulations. Due to
the memory bound nature, it is a challenging task to optimize stencil computation kernels on modern supercomputers
with relatively high computing throughput whilst relatively
low data-moving capability. This work serves as a demonstration on the details of the algorithms, implementations
and optimizations of a real-world stencil computation in 3D
nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling on the newly announced
Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. At the algorithm level, we
present a computation-communication overlapping technique
to reduce the inter-process communication overhead, a localityaware blocking method to fully exploit on-chip parallelism
with enhanced data locality, and a collaborative data accessing
scheme for sharing data among different threads. In addition,
a variety of effective hardware specific implementation and
optimization strategies on both the process- and thread-level,
from the fine-grained data management to the data layout
transformation, are developed to further improve the performance. Our experiments demonstrate that a single-process
many-core speedup of as high as 170x can be achieved by using
the proposed algorithm and optimization strategies. The code
scales well to millions of cores in terms of strong scalability.
And for the weak-scaling tests, the code can scale in a nearly
ideal way to the full system scale of more than 10 million cores,
sustaining 25.96 PFLOPS in double precision, which is 20%
of the peak performance.
