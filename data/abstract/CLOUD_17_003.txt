choose to deploy their applications in data centers to leverage
resource sharing. The increase in tasks of multiple applications,
however, makes it challenging for a data center provider to
maximize its revenue by intelligently scheduling tasks in softwaredefined networking (SDN)-enabled data centers. Existing SDN
controllers only reduce network latency while ignoring virtual
machine (VM) latency, thus may lead to revenue loss. In the
context of SDN-enabled data centers, this paper presents a
workload-aware revenue maximization (WARM) approach to
maximize the revenue from a data center providerâ€™s perspective.
The core idea is to jointly consider the optimal combination of
VMs and routing paths for tasks of each application. Comparing
with state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results show that
WARM yields the best schedules that not only increase the
revenue but also reduce the round-trip time of tasks of all
applications.
