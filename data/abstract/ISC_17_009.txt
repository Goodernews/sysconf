information retrieval, gene expression analysis, and numerical weather
prediction — require the solution of large dense singular value decompositions (SVD). In many cases the problems are too large to fit into
the computer’s main memory, and thus require specialized out-of-core
algorithms that use disk storage. In this paper, we analyze the SVD
communications, as related to hierarchical memories, and design a class
of algorithms that minimizes them. This class includes out-of-core SVDs
but can also be applied between other consecutive levels of the memory
hierarchy, e.g., GPU SVD using the CPU memory for large problems.
We call these out-of-memory (OOM) algorithms. To design OOM SVDs,
we first study the communications for both classical one-stage blocked
SVD and two-stage tiled SVD. We present the theoretical analysis and
strategies to design, as well as implement, these communication avoiding OOM SVD algorithms. We show performance results for multicore
architecture that illustrate our theoretical findings and match our performance models.
