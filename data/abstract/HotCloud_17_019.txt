code it is running. However, verified code identity is
currently not possible for programs launched on a cloud
by another party. We propose an approach to integrate
support for code attestation—authenticated statements of
code identity—into layered cloud platforms and services.

To illustrate, this paper describes TapCon, an attesting container manager that provides source-based attestation and network-based authentication for containers
on a trusted cloud platform incorporating new features
for code attestation. TapCon allows a third party to verify
that an attested container is running specific code bound
securely to an identified source repository. We also show
how to use attested code identity as a basis for access
control. This structure enables new use cases such as
joint data mining, in which two data owners agree on a
safe analytics program that protects the privacy of their
inputs, and then ensure that only the designated program
can access their data.
