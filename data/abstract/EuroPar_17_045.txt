
. In recent years, several lightweight thread (LWT) libraries
have emerged to tackle exascale challenges. These offer programming
models (PMs) based on user-level threads and incorporate their own
lightweight mechanisms. However, each library proposes its own PM,
exposing different semantics and hindering portability.

To address this drawback, we have designed Generic Lightweight
Thread (GLT), an application programming interface that frames the
functionality of the most popular LWT libraries for high-performance
computing under a single PM. We implement GLT on top of Argobots,
MassiveThreads, and Qthreads. We provide GLT as a dynamic library,
as well as in the form of a static version based on macro preprocessing
resolution to reduce overhead. This paper discusses the GLT PM and
demonstrates its minimal performance impact.
