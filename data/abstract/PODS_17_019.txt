relational schema with a special type of a relation symbolâ€”a
preference symbol. A deterministic instance of this symbol
holds a collection of binary relations. Abstractly, the probabilistic variant is a probability space over databases of the
augmented form (i.e., probabilistic database). Effectively,
each instance of a preference symbol can be represented
as a collection of parametric preference distributions such
as Mallows. We establish positive and negative complexity results for evaluating Conjunctive Queries (CQs) over
databases where preferences are represented in the Repeated
Insertion Model (RIM), Mallows being a special case. We
show how CQ evaluation reduces to a novel inference problem (of independent interest) over RIM, and devise a solver
with polynomial data complexity.
