metering, traffic monitoring, and sport analysis. In the Internet of
Things, billions of sensor nodes form a sensor cloud and offer data
streams to analysis systems. However, it is impossible to transfer all
available data with maximal frequencies to all applications. Therefore, we need to tailor data streams to the demand of applications.
We contribute a technique that optimizes communication costs
while maintaining the desired accuracy. Our technique schedules
reads across huge amounts of sensors based on the data-demands
of a huge amount of concurrent queries. We introduce user-defined
sampling functions that define the data-demand of queries and
facilitate various adaptive sampling techniques, which decrease
the amount of transferred data. Moreover, we share sensor reads
and data transfers among queries. Our experiments with real-world
data show that our approach saves up to 87% in data transmissions.
