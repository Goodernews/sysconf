Prior research has focused on the screen and the network
as the major sources of energy consumption. Through
carefully designed measurement-based experiments, we
show that for certain storage-intensive workloads, the
storage subsystem on an Android smartphone consumes
a significant amount of energy (36%), on par with screen
energy consumption. We analyze the energy consumption of different storage primitives, such as sequential
and random writes, on two popular mobile file systems,
ext4 and F2FS. In addition, since most Android applications use SQLite for storage, we analyze the energy
consumption of different SQLite operations. We present
several interesting results from our analysis: for example, random writes consume 19x higher energy than sequential writes, and that F2FS consumes half the energy as ext4 for most workloads. We believe our results
contribute useful design guidelines for the developers of
energy-efficient mobile file systems.
