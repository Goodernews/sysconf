procuring resources from computational spot markets such as
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Spot Instances. They
can take advantage of the price differentials across time slots,
regions, and instance types to minimize the total cost of running
their applications on the cloud. However, Spot markets are
inherently volatile and dynamic, as a consequence of which
Spot prices change continuously. As such, prospective bidders
can benefit from intelligent insights into the Spot market
dynamics that can help them make more informed bidding
decisions. To enable this, we propose a descriptive statistics
approach for the analysis of Amazon EC2 Spot markets to
detect typical pricing patterns including the presence of seasonal components, extremes and trends. We use three statistical
measures â€” the Gini coefficient, the Theil index, and the
exponential weighted moving average. We also devise a model
for estimating minimum bids such that the Spot instances will
run for specified durations with a probability greater than a
set value based on different look back periods. Experimental
results show that our estimation yields on average a bidding
strategy that can reliably secure an instance at least 80% of
the time at minimum target guarantee between 50% and 95%.
