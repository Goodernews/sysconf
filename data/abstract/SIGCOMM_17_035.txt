system resource management. We propose NFVnice, a user space
NF scheduling and service chain management framework to provide fair, efficient and dynamic resource scheduling capabilities on
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platforms. The NFVnice
framework monitors load on a service chain at high frequency
(1000Hz) and employs backpressure to shed load early in the service chain, thereby preventing wasted work. Borrowing concepts
such as rate proportional scheduling from hardware packet schedulers, CPU shares are computed by accounting for heterogeneous
packet processing costs of NFs, I/O, and traffic arrival characteristics. By leveraging cgroups, a user space process scheduling abstraction exposed by the operating system, NFVnice is capable of
controlling when network functions should be scheduled. NFVnice
improves NF performance by complementing the capabilities of the
OS scheduler but without requiring changes to the OSâ€™s scheduling mechanisms. Our controlled experiments show that NFVnice
provides the appropriate rate-cost proportional fair share of CPU
to NFs and significantly improves NF performance (throughput
and loss) by reducing wasted work across an NF chain, compared
to using the default OS scheduler. NFVnice achieves this even for
heterogeneous NFs with vastly different computational costs and
for heterogeneous workloads.
