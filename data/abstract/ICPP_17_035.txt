
 Clouds offer great flexibility for scaling applications due to the wide spectrum of resources with different
cost-performance, inherent resource elasticity and pay-peruse charging. However, determining cost-time-efficient cloud
configurations to execute a given application in the large
resource configuration space remains a key challenge. The
growing importance of elastic applications for which the
accuracy is a function of resource consumption introduces new
opportunities to exploit resource elasticity on clouds. In this
paper, we introduce CELIA, a measurement-driven analytical modeling approach to determine cost-time-optimal cloud
resource configurations to execute a given elastic application
with a time deadline and a cost budget. We evaluate CELIA
with three representative elastic applications on more than ten
million configurations consisting of Amazon EC2 resource types
with different cost-performance. Using CELIA, we show that
multiple cost-time Pareto-optimal configurations exist among
feasible cloud configurations that execute an elastic application
within a time deadline and cost budget. These Pareto-optimal
configurations exhibit up to 30% cost savings for an elastic
application representing n-body simulation. We investigate the
impact of fixed-time scaling on the cost of executing elastic
applications on cloud. We show that cost gradient with respect
to resource demand is smaller when cloud resources with better
cost-performance are used. Furthermore, we show that the
relative increase in cost is always smaller compared to the
relative reduction of execution time deadline. For example,
tightening the execution time deadline by two-thirds incurs only
40% increase in cost for the n-body simulation application.
