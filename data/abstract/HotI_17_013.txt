
RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is a technology that enables user applications to perform direct data
transfer between the virtual memory of processes on remote
endpoints, without operating system involvement or intermediate
data copies. Achieving zero intermediate data copies using
RDMA requires specialized network interface hardware. Software RDMA drivers emulate RDMA semantics in software to
allow the use of RDMA without investing in such hardware,
although they cannot perform zero-copy transfers. Nonetheless,
software RDMA drivers are useful for research, application
development, testing, debugging, or as a less expensive desktop
client for a centralized RDMA server application running on
RDMA-capable hardware.

Existing software RDMA drivers perform data transfer in
the kernel. Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) provides a
framework for mapping Ethernet interface cards into userspace
and performing bulk packet transfers. This in turn allows a
software RDMA driver to perform data transfer in userspace.
We present our software RDMA driver, urdma, that performs
data transfer in userspace, discuss its design and implementation,
and demonstrate that it can achieve lower small message latency
than existing kernel-based implementations while maintaining
high bandwidth utilization for large messages.
