
The exploitation of user search queries by search engines is at the
heart of their economic model. As consequence, offering private
Web search functionalities is essential to the users who care about
their privacy. Nowadays, there exists no satisfactory approach to
enable users to access search engines in a privacy-preserving way.
Existing solutions are either too costly due to the heavy use of
cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., private information retrieval protocols), subject to attacks (e.g., Tor, TrackMeNot, GooPIR) or rely
on weak adversarial models (e.g., PEAS). This paper introduces
X-Sgarcu, a novel private Web search mechanism building on the
disruptive Software Guard Extensions (SGX) proposed by Intel. We
compare X-Sgarcx to its closest competitors, Tor and PEAS, using
a dataset of real web search queries. Our evaluation shows that: (1)
X-Sgarcu offers stronger privacy guarantees than its competitors as
it operates under a stronger adversarial model; (2) it better resists
state-of-the-art re-identification attacks; and (3) from the performance perspective, X-Szarcu outperforms its competitors both in
terms of latency and throughput by orders of magnitude.
