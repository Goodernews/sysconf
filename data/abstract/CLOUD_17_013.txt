GPU devices are widely used for applications that require
extensive parallelism, such as deep learning. When the demand
of cloud computing instance is low, the surplus of resources is
provided at a lower price in the form of spot instance by AWS
EC2. This paper proposes DeepSpotCloud that utilizes GPUequipped spot instances to run deep learning tasks in a cost
efficient and fault-tolerant way. Thorough analysis about spot
instance price history logs reveals that GPU spot instances show
more dynamic price change pattern than other general types of
cloud computing resources. To deal with the price dynamicity
of the GPU spot instance, DeepSpotCloud utilizes instances in
different regions across continents as a single resource pool.
This paper also proposes a task migration heuristic by utilizing
a checkpointing mechanism of existing deep learning analysis
platform to conduct fast task migration when a running spot
instance is interrupted. Extensive experiments using real AWS
services prove that the proposed task migration method is
effective even in a WAN environment with limited network
bandwidth. Comprehensive simulations by replaying AWS EC2
price history logs reveal that DeepSpotCloud can achieve 13%
more cost gain than a state-of-the-art interrupt-driven scheduling
policy. The prototype of DeepSpotCloud is implemented using
various cloud computing services provided by AWS to serve real
deep learning tasks.
