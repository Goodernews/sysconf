
The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) runs the No.
4 supercomputer in the world, supported by a petascale file system, to facilitate scientific discovery. In this paper, using the daily
file system metadata snapshots collected over 500 days, we have
studied the behavioral trends of 1,362 active users and 380 projects
across 35 science domains. In particular, we have analyzed both individual and collective behavior of users and projects, highlighting
needs from individual communities and the overall requirements
to operate the file system. We have analyzed the metadata across
three dimensions, namely (i) the projectsâ€™ file generation and usage
trends, using quantitative file system-centric metrics, (ii) scientific
user behavior on the file system, and (iii) the data sharing trends of
users and projects. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the
first of its kind to provide comprehensive insights on user behavior from multiple science domains through metadata analysis of
a large-scale shared file system. We envision that this OLCF case
study will provide valuable insights for the design, operation, and
management of storage systems at scale, and also encourage other
HPC centers to undertake similar such efforts.
