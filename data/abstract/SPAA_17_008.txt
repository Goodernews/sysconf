single item of information throughout an undirected graph in synchronised rounds. In each round, each vertex which has received
the information in the previous round (possibly simultaneously
from more than one neighbour and possibly not for the first time),
‘pushes’ the information to b randomly selected neighbours. The
COBRA process is typically studied for integer branching rates
b > 2 (with the case b = 1 corresponding to a random walk). The
aim of the process is to propagate the information quickly, but with
a limited number of transmissions per vertex per round.

The cover time of COBRA is defined as the expected number of
rounds until each vertex has received the information at least once.
Our main results are a bound of O(m + (dmax)? log n) = O(n? log n)
on the COBRA cover time for an arbitrary connected graph with
n vertices, m edges and the maximum vertex degree dmax, and a
bound of O((r?+r/(1—A)) log n) for r-regular connected graphs with
the second eigenvalue A. Our bounds improve the O(n!/* log n)
and O((r*/¢2) log” n) bounds shown in [Mitzenmacher et al., SPAA
2016], where ¢ is the conductance of the graph, and complement
the O((1/(1 — A))? logn) bound shown in [Cooper et al., PODC
2016]. We obtain our bounds by analysing the process called Biased
Infection with Persistent Source (BIPS), which was introduced in
[Cooper et al., PODC 2016] as a dual process for COBRA .
