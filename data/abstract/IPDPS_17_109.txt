for space efficiency and reliability in flash-based storage systems
by reducing write traffic and space capacity demand. However,
it introduces noticeable processing overheads on the critical //O
path, which degrades the system performance significantly. Existing data compression schemes for flash-based storage systems
use fixed compression algorithms for all the incoming write
data, failing to recognize and exploit the significant diversity
in compressibility and access patterns of data and missing
an opportunity to improve the system performance, the space
efficiency or both. To achieve a reasonable trade-off between
these two important design objectives, in this paper we introduce
an Elastic Data Compression scheme, called EDC, which exploits
the data compressibility and access intensity characteristics by
judiciously matching data of different compressibility with different compression algorithms while leveraging the access idleness.
Specifically, for compressible data blocks EDC exploits the
compression diversity of the workload, and employs algorithms of
higher compression rate in periods of lower system utilization and
algorithms of lower compression rate in periods of higher system
utilization. For non-compressible (or very lowly compressible)
data blocks, it will write them through to the flash storage
directly without any compression. The experiments conducted
on our lightweight prototype implementation of the EDC system
show that EDC saves storage space by up to 38.7%, with an
average of 33.7%. In addition, it significantly outperforms the
fixed compression schemes in the I/O performance measure by
up to 61.4%, with an average of 36.7%.
