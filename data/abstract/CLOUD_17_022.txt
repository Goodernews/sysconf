
We present Timestamp Order Preserving (TOP),
a replicated state machine (RSM) protocol that exploits the
synchrony of networks to provide high performance. TOP uses
physical timestamp of synchronized clock as a consistent total
order to achieve consensus. It keeps estimating the bounds of
network latency and offset of synchronized clock to deduce the
commit time for each operation. It adopts speculative processing and reconciliation techniques to improve performance. To
demonstrate its advantages, we implement a key-value data store
that uses TOP for data replication. Through evaluations in a
geo-deployed testbed, by comparing it with Primary-Copy and
Quorum-Replication protocols, we demonstrate that TOP has a
similar commit latency with a higher sustainable throughput.
In addition, it processes operations in the order of submission
timestamp, which provides a stricter form of consistency.
