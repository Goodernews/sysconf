has considered the detailed characteristics of virtual machine (VM) behavior on VDI. In this paper, we analyze the enterprise storage traffic on commercial office
VDI using designated VMs. For 28 consecutive days,
we gathered various types of traces, including a usage
questionnaire and active and passive measurements. To
characterize the storage traffic, we focused on two perspectives: fibre channel (FC) traffic and VM behavior. From the FC traffic perspective, we found that
read traffic is dominant, although the applications are
similar to those in a previous small-scale VDI. In particular, the write response time of large transactions,
e.g.,128 KiB, is strongly affected by a slight decrease in
cache hits during an update storm. From the VM behavior, we found that all active user VMs generate only
25% of traffic. Although a few VMs generate massive
traffic, their impact is small. These characteristics are
unique in comparison with the small-scale VDI. Our results have significant implications for designing the next
generation of VDI and improving its performance.
