a weight vector. The score of an option (data record) is defined as
the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoring
options across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the
user as the recommended ones. In that setting, the user input is a
vector (equivalently, a point) in a d-dimensional preference space,
where d is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study the
problem of determining in which regions of the preference space
the weight vector should lie so that a given option (focal record) is
among the top-k score-wise. In effect, these regions capture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable,
and are therefore essential in market impact analysis, potential customer identification, profile-based marketing, targeted advertising,
etc. We refer to our problem as k-Shortlist Preference Region identification (KSPR), and exploit its computational geometric nature to
develop a framework for its efficient (and exact) processing. Using
real and synthetic benchmarks, we show that our most optimized
algorithm outperforms by three orders of magnitude a competitor
we constructed from previous work on a different problem.
