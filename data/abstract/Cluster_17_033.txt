
The last few years saw the emergence of 64-bit
ARM SoCs targeted for mobile systems and servers. Mobileclass SoCs rely on the heterogeneous integration of a mix of CPU
cores, GPGPU cores, and accelerators, whereas server-class SoCs
instead rely on integrating a larger number of CPU cores with no
GPGPU support and a number of network accelerators. Previous
works, such as the Mont-Blanc project, built their prototype
ARM < cluster out of mobile-class SoCs and compared their work
against x86 solutions. These works mainly focused on the CPU
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM-based
cluster organization that exploits faster network connectivity and
GPGPU acceleration to improve the performance and energy
efficiency of the cluster. Our custom cluster, based on Nvidia
Jetson TX1 boards, is equipped with 10Gb network interface
cards and enables us to study the characteristics, scalability
challenges, and programming models of GPGPU-accelerated
workloads. We also develop an extension to the Roofline model to
establish a visually intuitive performance model for the proposed
cluster organization. We compare the GPGPU performance of
our cluster with discrete GPGPUs. We demonstrate that our
cluster improves both the performance and energy efficiency
of workloads that scale well and can leverage the better CPUGPGPU balance of our cluster. We contrast the CPU performance
of our cluster with ARM-based servers that use many CPU cores.
Our results show the poor performance of the branch predictor
and L2 cache are the bottleneck of server-class ARM SoCs.
Furthermore, we elucidate the impact of using 10Gb connectivity
with mobile systems instead of traditional, 1Gb connectivity.
