
Multi-tiered memory systems, such as those based
on Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors, are equipped with several memory tiers with different characteristics including, among others,
capacity, access latency, bandwidth, energy consumption, and
volatility. The proper distribution of the application data objects
into the available memory layers is key to shorten the time—
to-solution, but the way developers and end-users determine
the most appropriate memory tier to place the application data
objects has not been properly addressed to date.

In this paper we present a novel methodology to build an
extensible framework to automatically identify and place the
application’s most relevant memory objects into the Intel Xeon
Phi fast on-package memory. Our proposal works on top of inproduction binaries by first exploring the application behavior
and then substituting the dynamic memory allocations. This
makes this proposal valuable even for end-users who do not
have the possibility of modifying the application source code. We
demonstrate the value of a framework based in our methodology
for several relevant HPC applications using different allocation
strategies to help end-users improve performance with minimal
intervention. The results of our evaluation reveal that our
proposal is able to identify the key objects to be promoted
into fast on-package memory in order to optimize performance,
leading to even surpassing hardware-based solutions.
