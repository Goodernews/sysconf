cloud systems. In this work, to effectively support user requests
with flexible timing constraints (e.g., users may prefer expedited services and are willing to pay extra for getting their job
processed at earlier times), we consider applications with multiple deadlines for being processed in resource-constrained cloud
systems and investigate corresponding virtual machine (VM)
provisioning schemes. Specifically, by considering the multiple
deadline-bid pairs of user requests, we propose a Slope-based
Time-Sensitive Resource Factor with Dominant Resource being
considered to prioritize such requests. In addition, we study
the mapping schemes that allocate multiple VMs of a user
request to only one or multiple computing nodes, which are
denoted as Bundled and Distributed mappings, respectively. The
evaluation results show that, compared to the single deadline
schemes, the proposed VM provisioning schemes that consider
multiple deadlines and distributed mapping can significantly
improve the achieved system benefit and resource utilization.
