
We discuss early results with Toucan, a sourceto-source translator that automatically restructures C/C++
MPI applications to overlap communication with computation.
We co-designed the translator and runtime system to enable
dynamic, dependence-driven execution of MPI applications,
and require only a modest amount of programmer annotation.
Co-design was essential to realizing overlap through dynamic
code block reordering and avoiding the limitations of static
code relocation and inlining. We demonstrate that Toucan hides
significant communication in four representative applications
running on up to 24K cores of NERSCâ€™s Edison platform.
Using Toucan, we have hidden from 33% to 85% of the communication overhead, with performance meeting or exceeding
that of painstakingly hand-written overlap variants.
