the prevalence of social networks (SNs). In this paper, we
study a new social influence problem, called personalized social influential tags exploration (PITEX), to help any user
in the SN explore how she influences the network. Given
a target user, it finds a size-k tag set that maximizes this
userâ€™s social influence. We prove the problem is NP-hard
to be approximated within any constant ratio. To solve
it, we introduce a sampling-based framework, which has an
approximation ratio of = with high probabilistic guarantee. To speedup the computation, we devise more efficient
sampling techniques and propose best-effort exploration to
quickly prune tag sets with small influence. To further
enable instant exploration, we devise a novel index structure and develop effective pruning and materialization techniques. Experimental results on real large-scale datasets validate our theoretical findings and show high performances of
our proposed methods.
