
Independent applications co-scheduled on the same
hardware will interfere with one another, affecting performance
in complicated ways. Predicting this interference is key to efficiently scheduling applications on shared hardware, but forming
accurate predictions is difficult because there are many shared
hardware features that could lead to the interference. In this
paper we investigate machine learning approaches (specifically,
regularization) to understand the relation between those hardware features and application interference. We propose ESP, a
highly accurate and fast regularization technique for application
interference prediction. To demonstrate this practicality, we
implement ESP and integrate it into a scheduler for both single
and multi-node Linux/x86 systems and compare the scheduling
performance to state-of-the-art heuristics. We find that ESP-based
schedulers increase throughput by 1.25-1.8x depending on the
scheduling scenario. Additionally, we find that ESPâ€™s accurate
predictions allow schedulers to avoid catastrophic decisions,
which heuristic approaches fundamentally cannot detect.
