
Demand for cloud computing has increased tremendously in
recent time due to various benefits. Along with providing promised services,
the cloud providers also need to focus on the amount of energy consumption
as it has many-fold benefits. Again scheduling algorithms play an important
role in minimizing the energy consumption of a system. Thus, in this paper,
we have proposed approaches for scheduling real time tasks on a virtualized
cloud system without missing their deadlines and minimizing the overall
energy consumption of the cloud system. We have divided the problem
of scheduling real-time tasks on virtualized cloud system into four sub
problems, analyzed and solved them separately. We have provided exact
solutions for scheduling of one type of real time tasks (sub problem 1),
created an approximated model for scheduling of two types of real time
tasks with same deadline (sub problem 2). We have also extended the same
approximated model for scheduling of many real time tasks with same
deadline (sub problem 3). Finally, we came up with four different approaches
for scheduling of general real time tasks using deadline clustering approach
(sub problem 4) and compared their performance in minimizing the overall
energy consumption of the cloud system.
