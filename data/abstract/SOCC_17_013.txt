potential revenue gain of thousands of candidate advertisements
per search query. The accuracy of this estimation is important for
revenue, but the cost of these computations represents a substantial
expense, e.g., 10% to 30% of the total gross revenue. Caching the
results of previous computations is a potential path to reducing
this expense, but traditional domain-agnostic and revenue-agnostic
approaches to do so result in substantial revenue loss. This paper
presents three domain-specific caching mechanisms that successfully optimize for both factors. Simulations on a trace from the Bing
advertising system show that a traditional cache can reduce cost
by up to 27.7% but has negative revenue impact as bad as —14.1%.
On the other hand, the proposed mechanisms can reduce cost by
up to 20.6% while capping revenue impact between —1.3% and 0%.
Based on Microsoft’s earnings release for FY16 Q4, the traditional
cache would reduce the net profit of Bing Ads by $84.9 to $166.1
million in the quarter, while our proposed cache could increase the
net profit by $11.1 to $71.5 million.
