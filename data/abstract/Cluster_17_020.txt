
High-radix, low-diameter, hierarchical networks
based on the Dragonfly topology are common picks for building
next generation HPC systems. However, effective tools are lacking
for analyzing the network performance and exploring the design
choices for such emerging networks at scale. In this paper, we
present visual analytics methods that couple data aggregation
techniques with interactive visualizations for analyzing largescale Dragonfly networks. We create an interactive visual analytics system based on these techniques. To facilitate effective analysis and exploration of network behaviors, our system provides
intuitive, scalable visualizations that can be customized to show
various traffic characteristics and correlate between different
performance metrics. Using high-fidelity network simulation and
HPC applications communication traces, we demonstrate the
usefulness of our system with several case studies on exploring
network behaviors at scale with different workloads, routing
strategies, and job placement policies. Our simulations and
visualizations provide valuable insights for mitigating network
congestion and inter-job interference.
