
We investigate efficient sensitivity analysis (SA) of
algorithms that segment and classify image features in a large
dataset of high-resolution images. Algorithm SA is the process
of evaluating variations of methods and parameter values to
quantify differences in the output. A SA can be very compute
demanding because it requires re-processing the input dataset
several times with different parameters to assess variations in
output. In this work, we introduce strategies to efficiently speed
up SA via runtime optimizations targeting distributed hybrid
systems and reuse of computations from runs with different
parameters. We evaluate our approach using a cancer image
analysis workflow on a hybrid cluster with 256 nodes, each
with an Intel Phi and a dual socket CPU. The SA attained a
parallel efficiency of over 90% on 256 nodes. The cooperative
execution using the CPUs and the Phi available in each node
with smart task assignment strategies resulted in an additional
speedup of about 2x. Finally, multi-level computation reuse
lead to an additional speedup of up to 2.46 on the parallel
version. The level of performance attained with the proposed
optimizations will allow the use of SA in large-scale studies.
