heuristics, bounds, and experimental results, but not much
asymptotically accurate complexity analysis. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel stochastic framework, based
on Glivenko-Cantelli results for functions of order statistics,
that allows modeling cost of in-memory triangle enumeration in families of random graphs. Unlike prior work that
usually studies the O(.) notation, we derive the exact limits
of CPU complexity of all vertex/edge iterators under arbitrary acyclic orientations as graph size n â€” oo. These results are obtained in simple closed form as functions of the
degree distribution. This allows us to establish optimal orientations for all studied algorithms, compare them to each
other, and discover the best technique within each class.
