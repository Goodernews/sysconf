
In this paper, we show how to integrate user-item
scoring into a graph-based tag-aware item recommender system.
Building upon the ProbS and PLIERS methods, we introduce
refined formulas for affinity and similarity scoring taking into
account user-item preference in the mass diffusion of
recommender systems. Additionally, we propose a two-step
similarity score that recommends items based on a repeated mass
diffusion on the item-tag graph. We denote the proposed method
as User Preference-based Probability Spreading for content
recommendation, UPPS. UPPS relies on the notion that the
influence of current user items on the recommendation process
should depend on the user item preference. To evaluate the
proposed approach, we employ the well-known MovieLens
dataset. In comparison to ProbS and PLIERS, UPPS yields an
improvement in both the NDCG@10 and P@10 measures by more
than 25% over ProbS and more than 100% over PLIERS.
