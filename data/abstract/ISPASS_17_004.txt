
The advent of high speed input sensor and
display technologies and the drive for faster interactive
response suggests that human-computer interaction
(HCI) task processing deadlines of a few milliseconds
or less may be required in future handheld devices.
At the same time, users will expect the same, if not
better, battery life than todayâ€™s devices under these
more stringent response requirements.

In this paper, we present a toolbox for exploring
the design space of HCI event processors. We first
describe the simulation platform for interactive environments that runs mobile user interface code with
inputs recorded from human users. We validate it
against a hardware platform from prior work. Given
system-level constraints on latency, we demonstrate
how this toolbox can be used to design a custom
heterogeneous event processor that maximizes battery
life. We show that our toolbox can pick design points
that are 1.5-2.5x more energy-efficient than generalpurpose big.LITTLE architectures.
