
We present a new method for scheduling independent tasks on a parallel machine composed of identical
processors. This problem has been studied extensively for a long
time with many variants. We are interested here in designing a
generic algorithm in the on-line non-preemptive setting whose
performance is good for various objectives. The basic idea of
this algorithm is to detect some problematic tasks that are
responsible for the delay of other shorter tasks. Then the
former tasks are redirected to be executed in a dedicated part
of the machine. We show through an extensive experimental
campaign that this method is effective and in most cases
is closer to some standard lower bounds than the base-line
method for the problem.
