
Heterogeneous chip-multiprocessors with integrated CPU and GPU cores on the same die allow sharing
of critical memory system resources among the applications
executing on the two types of cores. In this paper, we explore memory system management driven by the quality of
service (QoS) requirement of the GPU applications executing
simultaneously with CPU applications in such heterogeneous
platforms. Our proposal dynamically estimates the level of
QoS (e.g., frame rate in 3D scene rendering) of the GPU
application. Unlike the prior proposals, our algorithm does not
require any profile information and does not assume tile-based
deferred rendering. If the estimated quality of service meets the
minimum acceptable QoS level, our proposal employs a lightweight mechanism to dynamically adjust the GPU memory
access rate so that the GPU is able to just meet the required
QoS level. This frees up memory system resources which
can be shifted to the co-running CPU applications. Detailed
simulations done on a heterogeneous chip-multiprocessor with
one GPU and four CPU cores running heterogeneous mixes
of DirectX, OpenGL, and CPU applications show that our
proposal improves the CPU performance by 18% on average.
