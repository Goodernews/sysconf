
In a closely coupled heterogeneous computing system the work is shared amongst all available computing resources. One challenge is to find an optimal division of work
between the two or more very different kinds of processing units,
each with their own optimal settings. We show that through the
use of statistical techniques, a systematic search of the parameter
space can be conducted. These techniques can be applied to
variables that are categorical or continuous in nature and do not
rely on the standard assumptions of linear models, mainly that
the response variable can be described as a linear combination of
the regression coefficients. Our search technique, when applied
to the HPL benchmark, resulted in a performance gain of 14.5%
over previously reported results.
