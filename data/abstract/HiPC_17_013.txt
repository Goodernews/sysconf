in the static case, is NP-hard, compelling much of the research
to focus on heuristic-based approaches. However, there are
instances where exact solutions are desirable especially for
small network sizes. In this work, we present a dynamic
programming based exact solution to learn dynamic Bayesian
network structure. Our method simultaneously learns intra- as
well as higher order inter-time-slice interactions in the network.
For n variables, our exact solution requires O(n?.2"(“+1))
computations to learn M-th order network. To handle such
high computational requirements, we present a parallel exact
solution to push the limit on the size of the networks that can be
learned. Given p = 2° processors, the parallel algorithm runs
in O(n?.2”™ (2”—* + k)) time and achieves optimal parallel
efficiency when 2"—* > k, Using MPI+X parallel programming
model, the parallel algorithm linearly scales to 1,024 cores of
a 64-node Intel Xeon InfiniBand cluster, sustaining > 99% of
parallel efficiency. We also show that the learned networks
on gene network datasets are of high fidelity compared to
heuristic-based techniques.
