tool for tackling high dimensional problems. With many-core
systems readily available today, it is no surprise that leveraging
parallelism in these samplers has been a subject of recent
research. The focus has been on solutions for shared-memory
architectures, however these perform poorly in a distributedmemory environment. This paper introduces a fully decentralized version of an affine invariant sampler. By observing that a
pseudorandom number generator makes stochastic algorithms
deterministic, communication is both minimized and hidden by
computation. Two cases at opposite ends of the communicationto-computation ratio spectrum are used during evaluation
against the currently available master-slave solution, where a
more than tenfold reduction in execution time is measured.
