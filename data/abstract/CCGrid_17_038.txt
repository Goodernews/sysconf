
UCX is an open-source communication framework
with a two-level API design targeted at addressing the needs of
large supercomputing systems. The lower-level interface, UCT,
adds minimal overhead to data transfer but requires considerable
effort from the user. The higher-level interface, UCP, is easier to
use, but adds some overhead to the communication. This work
focuses on charting the performance of UCX over InfiniBand,
motivated by the usage of UCX as middleware for high-level
communication libraries. We analyze performance shortcomings
that stem from the two-level design and the sources of these
performance losses. In particular, we target basic functions of
UCP, evaluate their performance over InfiniBand, and analyze
sources of overheads compared with UCT and Verbs. We propose
and evaluate some fixes to minimize these overheads, in order to
enhance UCP performance and scalability.
