their operation. While such data allows interesting analysis and sophisticated algorithms, it is simply infeasible
to store all the data that is generated. However, collecting
only samples of the data greatly minimizes the usefulness
of the data. We present CC-LOG, a new logging system
built on top of the widely-used Robot Operating System that uses a combination of classification and compression techniques to reduce storage requirements. Experiments using the Building-Wide Intelligence Robot, a
mobile autonomous mobile platform capable of operating for long periods of time in human-inhabited environments, showed that our proposed system can reduce storage requirements by more than an order of magnitude.
Our results indicate that there is significant unrealized
potential in optimizing infrastructure commonly used in
robotics applications and research.
