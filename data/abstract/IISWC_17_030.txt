
Traditionally GPUs focused on streaming, dataparallel applications, with little data reuse or sharing and
coarse-grained synchronization. However, the rise of generalpurpose GPU (GPGPU) computing has made GPUs desirable
for applications with more general sharing patterns and finegrained synchronization, especially for recent GPUs that have
a unified address space and coherent caches. Prior work has
introduced microbenchmarks to measure the impact of these
changes, but each paper uses its own set of microbenchmarks.
In this work, we combine several of these sets together in a single
suite, HeteroSync. HeteroSync includes several synchronization
primitives, data sharing at different levels of the memory
hierarchy, and relaxed atomics. We characterize the scalability
of HeteroSync for different coherence protocols and consistency
models on modern, tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems and show
that certain algorithms, coherence protocols, and consistency
models scale better than others.
