by Brakerski and Patt-Shamir (2011), with the objective of
detecting the presence of large dense sub-networks in a distributed manner. Recently, Censor-Hillel et al. (2016) have
shown how to detect 3-cycles in a constant number of rounds
by a distributed algorithm. In a follow up work, Fraigniaud
et al. (2016) have shown how to detect 4-cycles in a constant
number of rounds as well. However, the techniques in these
latter works were shown not to generalize to larger cycles Cy
with k > 5. In this paper, we completely settle the problem
of cycle detection, by establishing the following result. For
every k > 3, there exists a distributed property testing algorithm for C,-freeness, performing in a constant number of
rounds. All these results hold in the classical CONGEST model
for distributed network computing. Our algorithm is 1-sided
error. Its round-complexity is O(1/e) where e â‚¬ (0,1) is the
property testing parameter measuring the gap between legal
and illegal instances.
