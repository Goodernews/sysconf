
Data races in multi-threaded parallel applications are notoriously
damaging while extremely difficult to detect. Many tools have been
developed to help programmers find data races. However, there is
no dedicated OpenMP benchmark suite to systematically evaluate
data race detection tools for their strengths and limitations.

In this paper, we present DataRaceBench, an open-source benchmark suite designed to systematically and quantitatively evaluate
the effectiveness of data race detection tools. We focus on data
race detection in programs written in OpenMP, the popular parallel
programming model for multi-threaded applications. In particular,
DataRaceBench includes a set of microbenchmark programs with
or without data races. These microbenchmarks are either manually
written, extracted from real scientific applications, or automatically
generated optimization variants.

We also define several metrics to represent effectiveness and
efficiency of data race detection tools. Using DataRaceBench and
its metrics, we evaluate four different data race detection tools: Helgrind, ThreadSanitizer, Archer, and Intel Inspector. The evaluation
results show that DataRaceBench is effective to provide comparable,
quantitative results and discover strengths and weaknesses of the
tools being evaluated.
