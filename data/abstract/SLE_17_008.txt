
Packrat parsing is a popular technique for implementing
top-down, unlimited-lookahead parsers that operate in guaranteed linear time. In this paper, we describe a method for
turning a standard packrat parser into an incremental parser
through a simple modification to its memoization strategy.
By łincremental”, we mean that the parser can perform syntax analysis without completely reparsing the input after
each edit operation. This makes packrat parsing suitable for
interactive use in code editors and IDEs — even with large
inputs. Our experiments show that with our technique, an
incremental packrat parser for JavaScript can outperform
even a hand-optimized, non-incremental parser.
