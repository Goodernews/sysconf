
The densification power law is a concept in the
realm of temporal graph evolution. The number of edges
grows in a power law over the number of nodes over time,
replacing the pre-2005 general assumption of a linear trend.
The densification power law has been verified by several real
networks over a long period of time. In this work, one such
graph, the arXiv citation network is investigated to examine
how the densification power law is working ten years after its
publication. The network is evaluated and compared with the
discussion in a previous work. It is observed that the graph
densification continues over time, but instead of maintaining
a constant densification power exponent, as suggested by
previous work, the exponent is actually dropping over time,
which suggests the densification power law is now fading away.
Here, this fading effect is literature analysed, and it is suggested
that node capability is the major obstacle to the continuation
of the original trend. To fully compare with the previous work
on graph evolution, the change of the average path length over
time is also investigated on our and otherâ€™s results. The results
imply the decreasing of the average path length in the temporal
evolution is very slow, which suggests that there exists a new
universal degree of separation in social networks of around
three.
