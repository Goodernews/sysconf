
Key-Value stores provide scalable metadata service for distributed
file systems. However, the metadataâ€™s organization itself, which is
organized using a directory tree structure, does not fit the key-value
access pattern, thereby limiting the performance. To address this
issue, we propose a distributed file system with a loosely-coupled
metadata service, LocoFS, to bridge the performance gap between
file system metadata and key-value stores. LocoFS is designed to
decouple the dependencies between different kinds of metadata
with two techniques. First, LocoFS decouples the directory content
and structure, which organizes file and directory index nodes in a
flat space while reversely indexing the directory entries. Second,
it decouples the file metadata to further improve the key-value
access performance. Evaluations show that LocoFS with eight nodes
boosts the metadata throughput by 5 times, which approaches 93%
throughput of a single-node key-value store, compared to 18% in
the state-of-the-art IndexFS.
