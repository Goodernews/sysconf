
High-bandwidth On-Package Memory (OPM) innovates the conventional memory hierarchy by augmenting a new on-package layer
between classic on-chip cache and off-chip DRAM. Due to its relative location and capacity, OPM is often used as a new type of LLC.
Despite the adaptation in modern processors, the performance and.
power impact of OPM on HPC applications, especially scientific
kernels, is still unknown. In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting
a comprehensive evaluation for a wide spectrum of scientific kernels
with a large amount of representative inputs, including dense, sparse
and medium, on two Intel OPMs: eDRAM on multicore Broadwell
and MCDRAM on manycore Knights Landing. Guided by our general optimization models, we demonstrate OPM’s effectiveness for
easing programmers’ tuning efforts to reach ideal throughput for
both compute-bound and memory-bound applications.
