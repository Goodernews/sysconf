large amounts of online streaming data in real-time or near
real-time. They have strict latency constraints, but they are
also vulnerable to failures. Failure recoveries may slow down
the entire processing pipeline and break latency constraints.
Upstream backup is one of the most widely applied fault-tolerant
schemes for stream processing systems. It introduces complex
backup dependencies to tasks, and increases the difficulty of
controlling recovery latencies. Moreover, when dependent tasks
are located on the same processor, they fail at the same time
in processor-level failures, bringing extra recovery latencies that
increase the impacts of failures. This paper presents a correlated
failure effect model to describe the recovery latency of a stream
topology in processor-level failures for an allocation plan. We
introduce a Recovery-latency-aware Task Allocation Problem
(RTAP) that seeks task allocation plans for stream topologies that
will achieve guaranteed recovery latencies. We present a heuristic
algorithm with a computational complexity of O(nlog? n) to
solve the problem. Extensive experiments were conducted to
verify the correctness and effectiveness of our approach.
