
Building self-healing SSDs is proven feasible by recent studies. When the stress of a block becomes critical, it can be
healed to remove part of the stress. However, with wear
leveling, all blocks are evenly worn and have similar stress,
and all blocks could undergo the healing process within a
short period of time. The intensive heal operations, called
heal storms, cause highly unpredictable I/O performance
and storage reliability. Inspired by the even distribution
of erase counts under wear leveling, we propose to operate
wear leveling on virtual erase counts instead of real erase
counts. When the balance among virtual erase counts is
achieved through wear leveling, all real erase counts become
evenly dispersed in a controlled interval. In this way, blocks
will undergo healing at different times. Virtual erase counts
are progressively adjusted such that all blocks reach their
endurance limit when the SSD permanently retires. Our results show that our approach successfully resolved the heal
storm problem without impacting on the SSD lifespan.
