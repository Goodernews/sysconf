everyday lives, e.g. weather forecast, design of plane and car
shapes, medical analysis or even search engine queries depend
on massively-parallel computer programs that are executed in
data centers hosting thousands of computers. A large amount
of electrical energy is used to power them, and it is of
primary importance to compute more efficiently to sustain the
increasing demand of computing power while keeping energy
consumption reasonable. One promising research path in this
domain is heterogeneous systems. The rationale for that is that
at least parts of applications execute more efficiently depending
on the computing resource (processors, accelerators, etc.).

Nevertheless, the exploitation of these heterogeneous platforms raises new challenges in terms of application management optimization on available computing resources. The aim
of our work is to determine effective algorithms to exploit
these heterogeneous platforms by finding the best mapping
and scheduling of an application to optimize the execution time
and energy consumption with respect to various constraints.
To achieve this goal, there is a need of a detailed modeling
of the applications and the underlying hardware to be able
to find realistic solutions. In this paper, we propose such as
model, provide two implementations with state-of-the-art tools
and preliminary mapping and scheduling numerical results.
