
Near-threshold computing is emerging as a
promising energy-efficient alternative for power-constrained
environments. Unfortunately, aggressive reduction in supply
voltage to the near-threshold range, albeit effective, faces a
host of challenges. This includes higher relative leakage power
and high error rates, particularly in dense SRAM structures
such as on-chip caches.

This paper presents an architecture that rethinks the cache
hierarchy in near-threshold multiprocessors. Our design uses
STT-RAM to implement all on-chip caches. STT-RAM has
several advantages over SRAM at low voltages including low
leakage, high density, and reliability. The design consolidates
the private caches of near-threshold cores into shared L1
instruction/data caches organized in clusters. We find that
our consolidated cache design can service more than 95% of
incoming requests within a single cycle. We demonstrate that
eliminating the coherence traffic associated with private caches
results in a performance boost of 11%. In addition, we propose
a hardware-based core management system that dynamically
consolidates virtual cores into variable numbers of physical
cores to increase resource efficiency. We demonstrate that this
approach can save up to 33% in energy.
