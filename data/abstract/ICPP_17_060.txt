
Power is a critical factor that limits the performance
and scalability of modern high performance computer systems.
Considering power as a first-order constraint and a scarce system
resource, power-bounded computing represents a new perspective
to address the power challenge in HPC.

In this work we present an application-aware, miultidimensional power allocation framework to support powerbounded parallel computing on NUMA-enabled multicore systems. This framework utilizes multiple complementary software
and hardware power management mechanisms to manage power
distribution among sockets, cores, and NUMA memory nodes
under a total power budget. More importantly, this framework
implements a hierarchical power coordination method that
leverages applicationsâ€™ performance and power scalability to
efficiently identify an ideal power distribution.

We describe the design of the framework and evaluate its
performance on a NUMA-enabled multicore system with 24
cores. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
performs close to the oracle solution for parallel programs with
various power budgets.
