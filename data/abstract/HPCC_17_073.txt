
The large-scale surveillance video processing workloads are gradually migrated to cloud computing platforms.
Meanwhile, the hybrid storage architecture, integrating both
HDD and SSD storage devices, is increasingly used in the current
cloud platforms. However, the computing and storage capabilities
of the nodes are constantly changing, and this requires the
delicate design of the data layout strategy for avoiding the serious
load skew in the distributed computing nodes with the hybrid
storage architecture. In this paper, we propose a Load-Aware
Data Migration (LADM) scheme for distributed surveillance
video processing with hybrid storage architecture. Specifically,
according to the proposed the load estimation model and the
storage capacity constraint, the Node-Level Data Migration
(NLDM) strategy is used to periodically migrate the appropriate
video chunks from the local HDD to the local SSD for improving
the node processing performance, and the Cluster-Level Data
Migration (CLDM) strategy is used to periodically migrate the
appropriate video chunks from the high load nodes to the low
load nodes for achieving the overall load balance of cluster.
We conduct the extensive experiments based on the distributed
surveillance video processing platform we developed, and the
experimental results show that the proposed LADM scheme
outperforms the current methods.
