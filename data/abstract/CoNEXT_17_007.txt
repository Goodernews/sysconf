
Currently, the attempt to choose the “best" content replica
server for a client is carried out solely by CDNs. While CDNs
have a decent view of load distribution and content placement, they receive little input from the clients themselves.
We propose a hybrid solution, subnet assimilation, where the
client participates in the server selection process while still
leaving the final say to the CDN. Subnet assimilation allows
clients to declare their own “network location," different from
the actual one, which in turn drives a CDN towards making better decisions. To demonstrate, we introduce Drongo,
a client-side system, readily deployable on existing clients
without any changes to the CDNs, that employs subnet assimilation to dramatically improve replica server selection.
We implemented and extensively evaluated Drongo on a
set of 429 clients spread across 177 countries and 6 major
CDNs. We show that Drongo affects 69.93% of all clients,
prompting better CDN replica choices which reduce the latency of affected requests by up to an order of magnitude
and by 24.89% on average across six major providers, with
Google’s performance improving by 50% in the median case.
Our results indicate that client participation holds great opportunities for the advancement of CDN performance.
