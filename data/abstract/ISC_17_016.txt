
. This paper presents a survey of architectural features among
four generations of Intel server processors (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge,
Haswell, and Broadwell) with a focus on performance with floating point
workloads. Starting at the core level and going down the memory hierarchy we cover instruction throughput for floating-point instructions, L1
cache, address generation capabilities, core clock speed and its limitations, L2 and L3 cache bandwidth and latency, the impact of Cluster on
Die (CoD) and cache snoop modes, and the Uncore clock speed. Using
microbenchmarks we study the influence of these factors on code performance. We show that the energy efficiency of the LINPACK and HPCG
benchmarks can be improved significantly by tuning the Uncore clock
speed without sacrificing performance, and that the Graph500 benchmark performance may benefit from a suitable choice of cache snoop
mode settings.
