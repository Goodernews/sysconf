
In this paper, we propose PGIS, a parallelism and
garbage collection aware I/O Scheduler, which identifies the hot
data based on trace characteristics to exploit the channel level
internal parallelism of flash-based storage systems. PGIS not
only fully exploits abundant channel resource in the SSD, but
also it introduces a hot data identification mechanism to reduce
the garbage collection overhead. By dispatching hot read data
to different channel, the channel level internal parallelism is
fully exploited. By dispatching hot write data to the same
physical block, the garbage collection overhead has been
alleviated. The experiment results show that compared with
existing I/O schedulers, PGIS improves the response time and
garbage collection performance significantly. Consequently,
PGIS reduces the garbage collection overhead up to 30.9%,
while exploiting channel level internal parallelism.
