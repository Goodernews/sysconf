most central and fundamental problems in distributed graph algorithms. Kutten and Peleg [KP98] devised an algorithm with running
time O(D + -Yn- log* n), where D is the hop-diameter of the input
n-vertex m-edge graph, and with message complexity O(m + n3/2),
Peleg and Rubinovich [PR99] showed that the running time of the
algorithm of [KP98] is essentially tight, and asked if one can achieve
near-optimal running time together with near-optimal message complexity.

In a recent breakthrough, Pandurangan et al. [PRS16] answered
this question in the affirmative, and devised a randomized algorithm
with time O(D + -Yn) and message complexity O(m). They asked if
such a simultaneous time- and message-optimality can be achieved
by a deterministic algorithm.

In this paper, building upon the work of [PRS16], we answer
this question in the affirmative, and devise a deterministic algorithm that computes MST in time O((D + Yn) - logan), using O(mlog n+ nlog n-log* n) messages. The polylogarithmic factors in the
time and message complexities of our algorithm are significantly
smaller than the respective factors in the result of [PRS16]. Also,
our algorithm and its analysis are very simple and self-contained, as
opposed to rather complicated previous sublinear-time algorithms
[GKP98, KP98, Elk04b, PRS16].
