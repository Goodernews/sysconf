exposed in security places Virtual Machine Introspection(V MI)
at risk: once attackers subvert any layers of cloud environment,
such as host, virtual machine manager(VMM) or qemu, VMI
will be exposed undoubtedly to those attackers too. Nearly all
existing VMI techniques implicitly assume that both VMM by
which VMI accesses specific VM data and host which VMI is
running on, are nonmalicious and immutable. Unfortunately,
this assumption can be potentially violated with the growing
shortage of security in cloud environment. Once VMM or
host is exploited, attackers can tamper the code or hijack the
data of VMI, then, falsify VM information and certifications
to Cloud systemâ€™s administrators who try to make sure the
security of specific VM in certain compute node. This paper
proposes a new trusted VMI monitor frame: T-VMI, which can
avoid the malicious subversion of the routine of VMI. T-VMI
guarantees the integrity of VMI code using isolation and the
correctness of VMI data using high privilege level instruction
and appropriate trap mechanism. This model is evaluated on a
simulation environment by using ARM Foundation Model 8.0
and has been presented on a real development ARMv8 JUNOr0 board. We finished the comprehensive experiments including
effectiveness and performance, and the result and analysis show
T-VMI has achieved the aim of expected effectiveness with
acceptable performance cost.
