
Property-graphs are becoming popular for Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDSs) because they allow to leverage distributed graph processing platforms in order to identify malicious
network traffic patterns. However, a benchmark for studying
their performance when operating on big data has not yet
been reported. In general, benchmarking a system involves the
execution of workloads on datasets, where both of them must
be representative of the application of interest. However, few
datasets containing real network traffic are openly available due
to privacy concerns, which in turn could limit the scope and
results of the benchmark. In this work, we build two synthetic
data generators for benchmarking next generation IDSs by
introducing the support for property-graphs in two well-known
graph generation algorithms: Barabasi-Albert and Kronecker.
We run an extensive experimental evaluation using a publicly
available dataset as seed for the data generation, and we show
that the proposed approach is able to generate synthetic datasets
with high veracity, while also exhibiting linear performance
scalability.
