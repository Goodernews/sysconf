fragmentation problem on mobile flash storage. From
our evaluation study with real Android smartphones, we
observed two interesting points on file fragmentation on
flash storage. First, defragmentation on mobile flash
storage is essential for high I/O performance on Android
smartphones because file fragmentation, which is a recurring problem (even after defragmentation), can significantly degrade I/O performance. Second, file fragmentation affects flash storage quite differently than HDDs.
When files are fragmented on flash storage, the logical fragmentation and the physical fragmentation are decoupled and a performance degradation mostly comes
from logical fragmentation. Motivated by our observations, we propose a novel defragger, janus defragger
(janusd), which supports two defraggers, janusdL for a
logical defragger and janusdP for a physical defragger.
JanusdL, which takes advantage of flash storageâ€™s internal logical to physical mapping table, supports logical
defragmentation without data copies. JanusdL is very
effective for most fragmented files while not sacrificing
the flash lifetime. JanusdP, which is useful for physically fragmented files but requires data copies, is invoked
only when absolutely necessary. By adaptively selecting
janusdL and janusdP, janusd achieves the effect of full
file defragmentation without reducing the flash lifetime.
Our experimental results show that janusd can achieve at
least the same level of I/O performance improvement as
e4defrag without affecting the flash lifetime, thus making janusd an attractive defragmentation solution for mobile flash storage.
