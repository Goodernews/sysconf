
 Identification of network traffic accurately at its
early stage is very important for network traffic management
and application traffic classification. In recent years, this
becomes very hot topic to identify traffic at its early stage.
Unidirectional and _ bidirectional statistical features are
effective features and widely used in Internet traffic
classification. However, it is important to evaluate and select
effective features for Instant Messaging (IM) application traffic
classification at early stage. In this paper we are interested to
find out robust and effective features at early stage. We firstly
extract 22 statistical features of the first flow on two different
network environment traffic datasets include on HIT and
NIMS datasets. Then mutual information is conducted between
the extract statistical features to select the effective features.
Additionally to select robust features, we execute attribute
selection cfsSubsetEval with Best search evaluator that select
the robust and stable features from the result achieved by
mutual information. And then, we execute 10 well-known
machine learning classifiers. Our experimental results show
that max_fpktl, std_bpktl, max_biat, mean_fpktl, mean_bpktl
and min_biat feature are robust features at early stage traffic
classification.
