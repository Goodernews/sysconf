
It is time to reconsider memory protection. The emergence of large non-volatile main memories, scalable
interconnects, and rack-scale computers running large
numbers of small “micro services” creates significant
challenges for memory protection based solely on MMU
mechanisms. Central to this is a tension between protection and translation: optimizing for translation performance often comes with a cost in protection flexibility.
We argue that a key-based memory protection scheme,
complementary to but separate from regular page-level
translation, is a better match for this new world. We
present MaKC, a new architecture which combines two
levels of capability-based protection to scale fine-grained
memory protection at both user and kernel level to large
numbers of protection domains without compromising
efficiency at scale or ease of revocation.
