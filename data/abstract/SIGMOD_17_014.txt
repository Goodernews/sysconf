attributes, has been the subject of recent research. A critical observation is that the convex hull is the subset of tuples that can be
used to find the maxima of any linear function. However, in real
world applications the convex hull can be a significant portion of
the database, and thus its performance is greatly reduced. Thus,
computing a subset limited to r tuples that minimizes the regret ratio (a measure of the userâ€™s dissatisfaction with the result from the
limited set versus the one from the entire database) is of interest.

In this paper, we make several fundamental theoretical as well
as practical advances in developing such a compact set. In the case
of two dimensional databases, we develop an optimal linearithmic
time algorithm by leveraging the ordering of skyline tuples. In
the case of higher dimensions, the problem is known to be NPcomplete. As one of our main results of this paper, we develop an
approximation algorithm that runs in linearithmic time and guarantees a regret ratio, within any arbitrarily small user-controllable
distance from the optimal regret ratio. The comprehensive set of
experiments on both synthetic and publicly available real datasets
confirm the efficiency, quality of output, and scalability of our proposed algorithms.
