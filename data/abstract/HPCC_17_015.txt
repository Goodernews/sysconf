micro-grids is treated both theoretically and experimentally.
An overview of the types of distributed islands in Wi-Fi
Long Distance networks is the starting point, followed by

examples of WiLDNets and associated reliability problems.

Presentation of an archetypical tree structure communication
system serves to introduce a centralized management system
that may be used to improve reliability of multi-community
private networks. An existing Wi-Fi long distance testbed
with distributed storage serves as an islanded micro-grid for
experimental study. Centralized management algorithms are
tested. The results are generalized to the case of large meshed
communication system.
