(across geo-distributed datacenters) of data distribution.
It becomes increasingly challenging but imperative to
minimize the response times of data analytic queries over
multiple geo-distributed datacenters. However, existing
scheduling-based solutions have largely been motivated
by pre-established mantras (e.g., bandwidth scarcity).
Without data-driven insights into performance bottlenecks at runtime, schedulers might blindly assign tasks
to workers that are suffering from unidentified bottlenecks.

In this paper, we present Lube, a system framework
that minimizes query response times by detecting and
mitigating bottlenecks at runtime. Lube monitors geodistributed data analytic queries in real-time, detects potential bottlenecks, and mitigates them with a bottleneckaware scheduling policy. Our preliminary experiments
on a real-world prototype across Amazon EC2 regions
have shown that Lube can detect bottlenecks with over
90% accuracy, and reduce the median query response
time by up to 33% compared to Sparkâ€™s built-in localitybased scheduler.
