
In the traditional sense, a subset repair of an inconsistent
database refers to a consistent subset of facts (tuples) that
is maximal under set containment. Preferences between
pairs of facts allow to distinguish a set of preferred repairs
based on relative reliability (source credibility, extraction
quality, recency, etc.) of data items. Previous studies explored the problem of categoricity, where one aims to determine whether preferences suffice to repair the database
unambiguously, or in other words, whether there is precisely
one preferred repair. In this paper we study the ability to
quantify ambiguity, by investigating two classes of problems.
The first is that of counting the number of subset repairs,
both preferred (under various common semantics) and traditional. We establish dichotomies in data complexity for the
entire space of (sets of) functional dependencies. The second
class of problems is that of enumerating (i.e., generating)
the preferred repairs. We devise enumeration algorithms
with efficiency guarantees on the delay between generated
repairs, even for constraints represented as general conflict
graphs or hypergraphs.
