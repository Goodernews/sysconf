
While many algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) schemes have
been proposed to detect soft errors offline in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) after computation finishes, none of the existing ABFT
schemes detect soft errors online before the computation finishes.
This paper presents an online ABFT scheme for FFT so that soft
errors can be detected online and the corrupted computation can
be terminated in a much more timely manner. We also extend our
scheme to tolerate both arithmetic errors and memory errors, develop strategies to reduce its fault tolerance overhead and improve
its numerical stability and fault coverage, and finally incorporate
it into the widely used FFTW library - one of the todayâ€™s fastest
FFT software implementations. Experimental results demonstrate
that: (1) the proposed online ABFT scheme introduces much lower
overhead than the existing offline ABFT schemes; (2) it detects
errors in a much more timely manner; and (3) it also has higher
numerical stability and better fault coverage.
