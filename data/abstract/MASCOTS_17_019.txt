
One of the key performance challenges in cloud computing is the problem of interference, or resource contention,
among colocated VMs. While prior work has empirically
analyzed interference for specific workloads under specific
settings, there is a need for a generic approach to estimate
application performance under any interference condition.

In this paper, we present an analytical model to estimate
performance as a function of various workload, system, and
interference conditions, including the intensity and length of
interference, for single- and multi-VM systems. Comparisons
with empirical results under various scenarios show that our
model can provide accurate latency estimations (less than
5% error). We employ our model to analyze systems under
interference, and derive useful results to aid practitioners.
