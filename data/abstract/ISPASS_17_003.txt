ability to provide infrastructure, platform and software services
to clients on a global scale. Using cloud services, clients reduce
the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying
hardware and software layers. Popular services like web search,
data analytics and data mining typically work with big data sets
that do not fit into top level caches. Thus performance efficiency
of last-level caches and the off-chip memory becomes a crucial
determinant of cloud application performance. In this paper we
use CloudSuite as an example and we study how prefetching
schemes affect cloud workloads. We conduct detailed analysis on
address patterns to explore the correlation between prefetching
performance and intrinsic workload characteristics. Our work
focuses particularly on the behavior of memory accesses at the
last-level cache and beyond. We observe that cloud workloads in
general do not have dominant strides. State-of-the-art prefetching
schemes are only able to improve performance for some cloud
applications such as web search. Our analysis shows that cloud
workloads with long temporal reuse patterns often get negatively
impacted by prefetching, especially if their working set is larger
than the cache size.
