
Object stores are becoming pervasive due to their
scalability and simplicity. Their broad adoption, however, contrasts with their rigidity for handling heterogeneous workloads and applications with evolving requirements, which prevents the adaptation of the system to
such varied needs. In this work, we present Crystal, the
first Software-Defined Storage (SDS) architecture whose
core objective is to efficiently support multi-tenancy in
object stores. Crystal adds a filtering abstraction at the
data plane and exposes it to the control plane to enable high-level policies at the tenant, container and object granularities. Crystal translates these policies into a
set of distributed controllers that can orchestrate filters at
the data plane based on real-time workload information.
We demonstrate Crystal through two use cases on top of
OpenStack Swift: One that proves its storage automation
capabilities, and another that differentiates IO bandwidth
in a multi-tenant scenario. We show that Crystal is an extensible platform to deploy new SDS services for object
stores with small overhead.
