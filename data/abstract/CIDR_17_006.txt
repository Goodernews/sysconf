
Ground is an open-source data context service, a system to manage
all the information that informs the use of data. Data usage has
changed both philosophically and practically in the last decade,
creating an opportunity for new data context services to foster further
innovation. In this paper we frame the challenges of managing data
context with basic ABCs: Applications, Behavior, and Change. We
provide motivation and design guidelines, present our initial design
of a common metamodel and API, and explore the current state of
the storage solutions that could serve the needs of a data context
service. Along the way we highlight opportunities for new research
and engineering solutions.
