
With the increasing size of HPC systems, the system mean time to
interrupt will decrease. This requires checkpoints to be stored in
a smaller time when using checkpoint/restart (C/R) for mitigation.
Multilevel checkpointing improves C/R efficiency by saving most
checkpoints to fast compute-node local storage. But it incurs a high
cost for writing a few checkpoints to slow global-I/O. We show
that leveraging NDP to offload writing of checkpoints to globalI/O improves C/R efficiency. We explore additional opportunities
using NDP to further reduce C/R overhead and evaluate checkpoint
compression using NDP as a starting point.
We evaluate the performance of our novel application of NDP for
C/R and compare it to existing C/R optimizations. Our evaluation for
a projected exascale system using multilevel checkpointing shows
that with NDP, the host processor is able to increase its efficiency on
an average from 51% to 78% (i.e., a >50% speedup in performance).
