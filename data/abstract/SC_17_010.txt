
We present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image
Analysis), a framework for coupling biophysical models with medical image analysis. It provides solvers for an image-driven inverse
brain tumor growth model and an image registration problem, the
combination of which can eventually help in diagnosis and prognosis of brain tumors. The two main computational kernels of SIBIA
are a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) implemented in the library
AccFFT to discretize differential operators, and a cubic interpolation
kernel for semi-Lagrangian based advection. We present efficiency
and scalability results for the computational kernels, the inverse
tumor solver and image registration on two x86 systems, Lonestar 5 at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and Hazel Hen at
the Stuttgart High Performance Computing Center. We showcase
results that demonstrate that our solver can be used to solve registration problems of unprecedented scale, 4096? resulting in ~ 200
billion unknownsâ€”a problem size that is 64x larger than the stateof-the-art. For problem sizes of clinical interest, SIBIA is about 8x
faster than the state-of-the-art.
