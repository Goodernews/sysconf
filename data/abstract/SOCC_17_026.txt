utilization, power efficiency, and maintenance. Various live migration algorithms have been proposed; each exhibiting distinct characteristics in terms of completion time, amount of data transferred,
virtual machine (VM) downtime, and VM performance degradation. To make matters worse, not only the migration algorithm but
also the applications running inside the migrated VM affect the
different performance metrics. With service-level agreements and
operational constraints in place, choosing the optimal live migration technique has so far been an open question. In this work, we
propose an adaptive machine learning-based model that is able to
predict with high accuracy the key characteristics of live migration
in dependence of the migration algorithm and the workload running inside the VM. We discuss the important input parameters for
accurately modeling the target metrics, and describe how to profile
them with little overhead. Compared to existing work, we are not
only able to model all commonly used migration algorithms but also
predict important metrics that have not been considered so far such
as the performance degradation of the VM. In a comparison with
the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed model outperforms
existing work by a factor 2 to 5.
