
Increasing scale of data centers and the density of
server nodes pose significant challenges in producing power and
energy efficient cooling infrastructures. Current fan based air
cooling systems have significant inefficiencies in their operation
causing oscillations in fan power consumption and temperature
variations among cores. In this paper, we identify the cause
these problems and propose proactive cooling mechanisms to
mitigate the power peaks and temperature variations.

An accurate temperature prediction model lies behind the
basis of our solutions. We use a neural network-based modeling approach for predicting core temperatures of different
workloads, under different core frequencies, fan speed levels,
and ambient temperature. The model provides guidance for
our proactive cooling mechanisms. We propose a preemptive
and decoupled fan control mechanism that can remove the
power peaks in fan power consumption and reduce the maximum cooling power by 53.3% on average as well as energy
consumption by 22.4%. Moreover, through our decoupled fan
control method and thermal-aware load balancing algorithm,
we show that temperature variations in large scale platforms
can be reduced from 25° C to 2° C, making cooling systems
more efficient with negligible performance overhead.
