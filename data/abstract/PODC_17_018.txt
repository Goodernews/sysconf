network, so that a function on two nodes (such as distance or
adjacency) can be computed by examining their labels alone. For
the particular case of trees, following a long line of research, optimal
bounds (up to low order terms) were recently obtained for adjacency
labeling [FOCS °15], nearest common ancestor labeling [SODA
*14], and ancestry labeling [SICOMP ’06]. In this paper we obtain
optimal bounds for distance labeling. We present labels of size
1/4 log? n + o(log” n), matching (up to low order terms) the recent
1/4 log? n — O(log n) lower bound [ICALP ’16].

Prior to our work, all distance labeling schemes for trees could
be reinterpreted as universal trees. A tree T is said to be universal
if any tree on n nodes can be found as a subtree of T. A universal
tree with |T| nodes implies a distance labeling scheme with label
size log |T|. In 1981, Chung et al. proved that any distance labeling
scheme based on universal trees requires labels of size 1/2 log? n —
logn - log log n + O(log n). Our scheme is the first to break this
lower bound, showing a separation between distance labeling and
universal trees.

The O(log? n) barrier for distance labeling in trees has led researchers to consider distances bounded by k. The size of such
labels was shown to be logn + O(k./logn) in [WADS ’01], and
then improved to log n + O(k? log(k log n)) in [SODA ’03] and finally to log n + O(k log(k log(n/k))) in [PODC ’07]. We show how
to construct labels whose size is the minimum between logn +
O(k log((log n)/k)) and O(log n-log(k/ log n)). We complement this
with almost tight lower bounds of logn + O(k log(log n/(k log k)))
and O(log n-log(k/ log n)). Finally, we consider (1+ ¢)-approximate
distances. We show that the recent labeling scheme of [ICALP ’16]
can be easily modified to obtain an O(log(1/e) - log n) upper bound
and we prove a matching O(log(1/e) - log n) lower bound.
