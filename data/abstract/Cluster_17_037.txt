
Scientific data sets, which grow rapidly in volume,
are often attached with plentiful metadata, such as their associated experiment or simulation information. Thus, it becomes
difficult for them to be utilized and their value is lost over
time. Ideally, metadata should be managed along with its corresponding data by a single storage system, and can be accessed
and updated directly. However, existing storage systems in highperformance computing (HPC) environments, such as Lustre
parallel file system, still use a static metadata structure composed
of non-extensible and fixed amount of information. The burden
of metadata management falls upon the end-users and require
ad-hoc metadata management software to be developed.

With the advent of “object-centric’”’ storage systems, there is an
opportunity to solve this issue. In this paper, we present SoMeta,
a scalable and decentralized metadata management approach
for object-centric storage in HPC systems. It provides a flat
namespace that is dynamically partitioned, a tagging approach to
manage metadata that can be efficiently searched and updated,
and a light-weight and fault tolerant management strategy. In
our experiments, SoMeta achieves up to 3.7X speedup over
Lustre in performing common metadata operations, and up to
16X faster than SciDB and MongoDB for advanced metadata
operations, such as adding and searching tags. Additionally, in
contrast to existing storage systems, SoMeta offers scalable userspace metadata management by allowing users with the capability
to specify the number of metadata servers depending on their
workload.
