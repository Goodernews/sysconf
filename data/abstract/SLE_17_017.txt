and energy consumption of twenty seven well-known software languages. We monitor the performance of such languages using ten different programming problems, expressed
in each of the languages. Our results show interesting findings, such as, slower/faster languages consuming less/more
energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We show how to use our results to provide software
engineers support to decide which language to use when
energy efficiency is a concern.
