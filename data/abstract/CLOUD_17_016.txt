that leverages visualized signal images through visual analytics
and deep learning. At a mobile client, such as a smart phone, this
approach transforms multidimensional signals captured at a
known location and at a given time into a signal image and
transmits such visual signal images to the Cloud. By collecting and
storing many such visual signal images as fingerprints, we can
build a visual signal image cloud and produce a signal image map
for the geographical region of interest and utilize such signal image
map to serve the positioning requests of mobile clients on the move.
When a user Alice wants to know her current position, her mobile
client will generate a signal image from the multiple signals it
receives with timestamp and send this query image to a Cloud
server. The server searches the existing signal images stored in the
cloud to find those that are similar to this query signal image and
estimates the positioning of Alice based on the locations of those
similar signal images collected by the server. We evaluate our
visual signal images based positioning system on the entire two
floors of a large department store and on the street and shops
outside the department store, with the signal images collected over
30 minutes before serving positioning queries. The mean error of
up to 4 meters is observed. To further verify the applicability of
the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted to
distinguish whether a user is indoor or outdoor by applying a deep
learning algorithm with 60% of signal images collected for
training and 40% signal images for testing. This experiment shows
that the proposed method is able to distinguish indoor and outdoor
with accuracy of about 95%.
