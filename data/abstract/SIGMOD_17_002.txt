similarity score between two nodes, and it has been widely used in
various applications, such as link prediction and recommendation.
Due to the high computational cost and space cost of computing the
exact Personalized PageRank Vector (PPV), most existing studies
compute PPV approximately. In this paper, we propose novel and
efficient distributed algorithms that compute PPV exactly based
on graph partitioning on a general coordinator-based share-nothing
distributed computing platform. Our algorithms takes three aspects
into account: the load balance, the communication cost, and the
computation cost of each machine. The proposed algorithms only
require one time of communication between each machine and the
coordinator at query time. The communication cost is bounded, and
the work load on each machine is balanced. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five real datasets demonstrate the efficiency
and the scalability of our proposed methods.
