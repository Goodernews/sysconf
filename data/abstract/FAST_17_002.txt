
TTFLASH is a “tiny-tail” flash drive (SSD) that eliminates GC-induced tail latencies by circumventing GCblocked I/Os with four novel strategies: plane-blocking
GC, rotating GC, GC-tolerant read, and GC-tolerant
flush. It is built on three SSD internal advancements:
powerful controllers, parity-based RAIN, and capacitorbacked RAM, but is dependent on the use of intra-plane
copyback operations. We show that TTFLASH comes significantly close to a “no-GC” scenario. Specifically, between 99-99.99th percentiles, TTFLASH is only 1.0 to
2.6 slower than the no-GC case, while a base approach
suffers from 5—138x GC-induced slowdowns.
