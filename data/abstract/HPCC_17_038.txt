
 â€” Ethernet is being expanded to many industrial
automation applications, and the demand for high availability
drives the adoption of High Availability Seamless
Redundancy (HSR) due to its capability to achieve zero
recovery time. A major challenge of HSR is long delay of
large HSR network due to its ring architecture. A solution to
this issue is to use QuadBox to design multiple rings which
raise many design questions because of different architecture
options. Our approach is to apply the concept of SS7
signaling to classify the links as A, B, C, and D from which
we present a flexible and scalable architecture. We
developed a simulation model to validate this architecture,
and the results show that one-way delay is not negatively
affected by network growth. Another contribution of this
paper is to use a central controller, like Software Defined
Network (SDN), to create MAC forwarding tables on
individual HSR nodes. The proposed scheme prevents
flooding and broadcast storm in this loop topology.
