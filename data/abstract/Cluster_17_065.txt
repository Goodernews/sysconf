
In this paper, we present a non-parametric dataanalytic soft-error detector. Our detector uses the key properties of Gaussian process regression. First, because Gaussian
process regression provides confidence on the prediction, this
confidence can be used to automatize construction of the
detection range. Second, because the correlation model of a
Gaussian process captures the similarity among neighboring
point values, only one-time online training is needed. This leads
to very low online performance overheads. Finally, Gaussian
process regression localizes the detection range computation,
thereby avoiding communication costs. We compare our detector with the adaptive impact-driven (AID) and spatial supportvector-machine (SSD) detectors, two effective detectors based
on observation of the temporal and spatial evolution of data,
respectively. Experiments with five failure distributions and
six real-world high-performance computing applications reveal
that the Gaussian-process-based detector achieves low false
positive rate and high recall while incurring less than 0.1%
performance and memory overheads. Considering the detection
performance and overheads, our Gaussian process detector
provides the best trade-off.
