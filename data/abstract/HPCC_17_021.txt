
In cloud datacenters, energy-efficient Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) mechanism is needed to maximize energy
efficiency. Existing virtual machine (VM) allocation strategies
based on whether the VMsâ€™ resource demands are assumed
to be static or dynamic. Apparently, the former fails to fully
utilize resources while the latter, which is implemented on shorter
timescales, is either complicated or inefficient. Moreover, most
prior VMP algorithms place VMs one by one, which lacks
an optimization space. To handle these problems, we predict
Gaussian distribution patterns of VM demands and propose
an ant-colony-system VM placement algorithm (GACO-VMP)
which synchronously coordinates the VMs with complementary
resource requirements on the same server. The Gaussian distribution pattern is derived from the VMs running the same job. This
mechanism minimizes energy consumption, while guaranteeing
high resource utilization and also balancing resource utilization
across multiple resources. In addition, we design two new metrics,
called cumulative utilization ratio(CUR) and resource balance
distance (RBD), in order to measure the overall resource utilization level and the equilibrium of multi-dimensional resource
utilization, respectively. Simulations based on Google Cluster
real trace indicate that GACO-VMP can achieve remarkable
performance gains over two existing strategies in energy efficiency
3VM migrations, resource utilization and resource balance.
