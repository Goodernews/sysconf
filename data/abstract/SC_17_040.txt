
In this paper, we describe the GUIDE framework used to collect,
federate, and analyze log data from the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF), and how we use that data to derive insights
into facility operations. We collect system logs and extract monitoring data at every level of the various OLCF subsystems, and
have developed a suite of pre-processing tools to make the raw
data consumable. The cleansed logs are then ingested and federated
into a central, scalable data warehouse, Splunk, that offers storage,
indexing, querying, and visualization capabilities. We have further
developed and deployed a set of tools to analyze these multiple
disparate log streams in concert and derive operational insights. We
describe our experience from developing and deploying the GUIDE
infrastructure, and deriving valuable insights on the various subsystems, based on two years of operations in the production OLCF
environment.
