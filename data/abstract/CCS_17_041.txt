supports fine-grained access control on encrypted data, making
it an appealing building block for many applications. In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate fully automated methods
for proving security of ABE in the Generic Bilinear Group Model
(Boneh, Boyen, and Goh, 2005, Boyen, 2008), an idealized model
which admits simpler and more efficient constructions, and can
also be used to find attacks. Our method is applicable to RationalFraction Induced ABE, a large class of ABE that contains most of the
schemes from the literature, and relies on a Master Theorem, which
reduces security in the GGM to a (new) notion of symbolic security,
which is amenable to automated verification using constraint-based
techniques. We relate our notion of symbolic security for RationalFraction Induced ABE to prior notions for Pair Encodings. Finally,
we present several applications, including automated proofs for
new schemes.
