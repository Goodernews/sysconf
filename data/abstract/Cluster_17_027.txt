
A proliferation of data from vast networks of remote
sensing platforms (satellites, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS),
airborne etc.), observational facilities (meteorological, eddy covariance etc.), state-of-the-art sensors, and simulation models
offer unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery. Unsupervised classification is a widely applied data mining approach
to derive insights from such data. However, classification of very
large data sets is a complex computational problem that requires
efficient numerical algorithms and implementations on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. Additionally, increasing
power, space, cooling and efficiency requirements has led to the
deployment of hybrid supercomputing platforms with complex
architectures and memory hierarchies like the Titan system at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The advent of such accelerated
computing architectures offers new challenges and opportunities
for big data analytics in general and specifically, large scale
cluster analysis in our case. Although there is an existing body
of work on parallel cluster analysis, those approaches do not
fully meet the needs imposed by the nature and size of our large
data sets. Moreover, they had scaling limitations and were mostly
limited to traditional distributed memory computing platforms.
We present a parallel Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering
(MSTC) technique based on k-means cluster analysis that can
target hybrid supercomputers like Titan. We developed a hybrid
MPI, CUDA and OpenACC implementation that can utilize both
CPU and GPU resources on computational nodes. We describe
performance results on Titan that demonstrate the scalability
and efficacy of our approach in processing large ecological data
sets.
