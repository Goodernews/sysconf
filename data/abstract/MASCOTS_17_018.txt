
This paper investigates the problem of deriving a white box performance model of Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) systems. The proposed model
targets TSX, a popular implementation of HTM integrated
in Intel processors starting with the Haswell family in 2013.

An inherent difficulty with building white-box models of
commercially available HTM systems is that their internals
are either vaguely documented or undisclosed by their
manufacturers. We tackle this challenge by designing a set
of experiments that allow us to shed lights on the internal
mechanisms used in TSX to manage conflicts among
transactions and to track their readsets and writesets.

We exploit the information inferred from this experimental study to build an analytical model of TSX focused on capturing the impact on performance of two
key mechanisms: the concurrency control scheme and the
management of transactional meta-data in the processorâ€™s
caches. We validate the proposed model by means of an
extensive experimental study encompassing a broad range
of workloads executed on a real system.
