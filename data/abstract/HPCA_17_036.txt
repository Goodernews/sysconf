
This paper presents the Compute Cache architecture that enables in-place computation in caches. Compute
Caches uses emerging bit-line SRAM circuit technology to repurpose existing cache elements and transforms them into active very large vector computational units. Also, it significantly
reduces the overheads in moving data between different levels
in the cache hierarchy.

Solutions to satisfy new constraints imposed by Compute
Caches such as operand locality are discussed. Also discussed
are simple solutions to problems in integrating them into a
conventional cache hierarchy while preserving properties such
as coherence, consistency, and reliability.

Compute Caches increase performance by 1.9x and reduce
energy by 2.4x for a suite of data-centric applications, including text and database query processing, cryptographic kernels,
and in-memory checkpointing. Applications with larger fraction of Compute Cache operations could benefit even more, as
our micro-benchmarks indicate (54x throughput, 9x dynamic
energy savings).
