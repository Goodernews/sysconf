many domains has made it necessary for data management systems
to manage many thousands to millions of versions of datasets,
acquired or constructed at various stages of analysis pipelines over
time. Delta encoding is an effective and widely-used solution to
compactly store a large number of datasets, that simultaneously
exploits redundancies across them and keeps the average retrieval
cost of reconstructing any dataset low. However, supporting any
kind of rich retrieval or querying functionality, beyond single dataset
checkout, is challenging in such storage engines. In this paper, we
initiate a systematic study of this problem, and present DEX, a novel
stand-alone delta-oriented execution engine, whose goal is to take
advantage of the already computed deltas between the datasets for
efficient query processing. In this work, we study how to execute
checkout, intersection, union and t-threshold queries over recordbased files; we show that processing of even these basic queries leads
to many new and unexplored challenges and trade-offs. Starting from
a query plan that confines query execution to a small set of deltas, we
introduce new transformation rules based on the algebraic properties
of the deltas, that allow us to explore the search space of alternative
plans. For the case of checkout, we present a dynamic programming
algorithm to efficiently select the optimal query plan under our cost
model, while we design efficient heuristics to select effective plans
that vastly outperform the base checkout-then-query approach for
other queries. A key characteristic of our query execution methods
is that the computational cost is primarily dependent on the size
and the number of deltas in the expression (typically small), and
not the input dataset versions (which can be very large). We have
implemented DEX prototype on top of git, a widely used version
control system. We present an extensive experimental evaluation
on synthetic data with diverse characteristics, that shows that our
methods perform exceedingly well compared to the baseline.
