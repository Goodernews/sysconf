on the names of shared memory locations, as done in almost all
the publications on shared memory algorithms, is tantamount to
assuming that agreement has already been solved at the lower-level.
From a theoretical point of view, it is intriguing to figure out how
coordination can be achieved without relying on such lower-level
agreement. In order to better understand the new model, we have
designed new algorithms without relying on such a priori lowerlevel agreement, and proved space lower bounds and impossibility
results for several important problems, such as mutual exclusion,
consensus, election and renaming. Using these results, we identify
fundamental differences between the standard model where there
is a lower-level agreement about the shared registerâ€™s names and
the strictly weaker model where there is no such agreement.
