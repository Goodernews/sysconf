scientific domains, demanding cost-effective parallel data analysis techniques. Traditional Java-based Big Data processing
tools like Hadoop MapReduce are designed for commodity
CPUs. In contrast, emerging manycore processors like Xeon
Phi has an order of magnitude of computation power and
memory bandwidth. To harness the computing capabilities, we
propose a Harp-DAAL framework. We show that enhanced
versions of MapReduce can be replaced by Harp, a Hadoop
plug-in, that offers useful data abstractions for both of highperformance iterative computation and MPI-quality communication, and it can drive Intelâ€™s native library DAAL. We select
a subset of three machine learning algorithms and implement
them within Harp-DAAL. Our scalability benchmarks run on
Knights Landing (KNL) clusters and achieve up to 2.5 times
speedup of performance to the HPC solution in NOMAD and
15 to 40 times faster than Java-based solutions in Spark. We
further quantify the workloads on single node KNL with a
performance breakdown at micro-architecture level.
