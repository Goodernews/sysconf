
Bitcoin introduces a revolutionary decentralized
consensus mechanism. However, Bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms applied to public blockchain are inadequate for the
deployment scenarios of budding consortium blockchain. We
propose a new consensus algorithm, Proof of Vote (POV). The
consensus is coordinated by the distributed nodes controlled
by consortium partners which will come to a decentralized
arbitration by voting. The key idea is to establish different
security identity for network participants, so that the submission
and verification of the blocks are decided by the agencies’ voting
in the league without the depending on a third-party intermediary or uncontrollable public awareness. Compared with
the fully decentralized consensus—Proof of Work (POW), POV
has controllable security, convergence reliability, only one block
confirmation to achieve the transaction finality, and low-delay
transaction verification time.
