
Efficient execution of distributed database operators such as joining and aggregating is critical for the
performance of big data analytics. With the increase of the
compute speedup of modern CPUs, reducing the network
communication time of these operators in large systems is
becoming increasingly important, and also challenging current
techniques. Significant performance improvements have been
achieved by using state-of-the-art methods, such as reducing
network traffic designed in the data management domain,
and data flow scheduling in the data communications domain.
However, the proposed techniques in both fields just view
each other as a black box, and performance gains from a
co-optimization perspective have not yet been explored.

In this paper, based on current research in coflow scheduling,
we propose a novel Coflow-based Co-optimization Framework
(CCF), which can co-optimize application-level data movement
and network-level data communications for distributed operators, and consequently contribute to their performance in
large distributed environments. We present the detailed design
and implementation of CCF, and conduct an experimental
evaluation of CCF using large-scale simulations on large data
joins. Our results demonstrate that CCF can always perform
faster than current approaches on network communications in
large-scale distributed scenarios.
