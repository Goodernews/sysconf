as a technical breakthrough by academia. However, the expanding
potential of Bitcoin is largely untapped due to its limited throughput.
The Bitcoin community is now facing its biggest crisis in history as
the community splits on how to increase the throughput. Among
various proposals, Bitcoin Unlimited recently became the most
popular candidate, as it allows miners to collectively decide the
block size limit according to the real network capacity. However,
the security of BU is heatedly debated and no consensus has been
reached as the issue is discussed in different miner incentive models. In this paper, we systematically evaluate BU’s security with
three incentive models via testing the two major arguments of BU
supporters: the block validity consensus is not necessary for BU’s
security; such consensus would emerge in BU out of economic
incentives. Our results invalidate both arguments and therefore
disprove BU’s security claims. Our paper further contributes to
the field by addressing the necessity of a prescribed block validity
consensus for cryptocurrencies.
