separate machines. These machines present diverse performance
and power consumption profiles and we show that significant potential benefits for both metrics can be expected, should these
machines be able to cooperate in the processing of datacenter, multiprogrammed workloads. We advocate that this cooperation should
be enabled at the level of the OS, relieving the programmer from
any effort related to the heterogeneity of the managed machines.
We propose a distributed OS architecture running on a fully heterogeneous computer cluster, enabling this cooperation through
three main components: the abstraction of the entire cluster in a
single system image, a distributed shared memory system, and a
heterogeneous scheduler.
