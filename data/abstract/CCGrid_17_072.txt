
Concerns about protecting personal data and intellectual property are major obstacles to the adoption of cloud
services. To ensure that a cloud tenant’s data cannot be accessed
by malicious code from another tenant, critical software components of different tenants are traditionally deployed on separate
physical machines. However, such physical separation limits
hardware utilization, leading to cost overheads due to inefficient
resource usage. Secure hardware enclaves offer mechanisms to
protect code and data from potentially malicious code deployed
on the same physical machine, thereby offering an alternative
to physical separation. We show how secure hardware enclaves
can be employed to address data protection concerns of cloud
tenants, while optimizing hardware utilization. We provide a
model, formalization and experimental evaluation of an efficient
algorithmic approach to compute an optimized deployment of
software components and virtual machines, taking into account
data protection concerns and the availability of secure hardware
enclaves. Our experimental results suggest that even if only a
small percentage of the physical machines offer secure hardware
enclaves, significant cost savings can be achieved.
