
A datacenter’s power consumption is a major contributor to its operational expenditures (op-ex) and one-time capital expenditures (cap-ex). The recurring electricity cost is often in
large determined by datacenter peak-demand under peak-based
pricing which is employed by major electric utility providers.
There is a growing interest in reducing a datacenter’s electricity
costs by using throttling techniques and/or energy storage devices
(batteries) which are readily available at most datacenters as a
backup energy source. A datacenter’s power-demand uncertainty
makes this a challenging problem, which is largely neglected
in existing work, by assuming perfect predictability of power
demand. We model this inherent uncertainty as a Markov chain
and also evaluate the risk of over/under charging batteries as a
result of the randomness in power demand. We design an online
optimization framework for peak shaving which considers Conditional Value at Risk and allows for navigating cost-risk trade-offs
of datacenters based on their energy infrastructure and workload
characteristics. We show that this framework offers significantly
higher (up to 2x) cost-savings with small risks of over/under
charging batteries, compared to existing stochastic optimization
techniques. This framework leverages Markov Decision Processes
to perform online dynamic peak shaving, considering battery
degradation costs under peak-based pricing.
