
During the past decade, network and storage devices
have undergone rapid performance improvements, delivering ultra-low latency and several Gbps of bandwidth. Nevertheless, current network and storage stacks fail to deliver
this hardware performance to the applications, often due
to the loss of IO efficiency from stalled CPU performance.
While many efforts attempt to address this issue solely on
either the network or the storage stack, achieving highperformance for networked-storage applications requires a
holistic approach that considers both.

In this paper, we present FlashNet, a software IO stack
that unifies high-performance network properties with flash
storage access and management. FlashNet builds on
RDMA principles and abstractions to provide a direct, asynchronous, end-to-end data path between a client and remote
flash storage. The key insight behind FlashNet is to codesign the stack’s components (an RDMA controller, a flash
controller, and a file system) to enable cross-stack optimizations and maximize IO efficiency. In micro-benchmarks,
FlashNet improves 4kB network IOPS by 38.6% to 1.22M,
decreases access latency by 43.5% to 50.4 secs, and prolongs the flash lifetime by 1.6-5.9x for writes. We illustrate
the capabilities of FlashNet by building a Key-Value store,
and porting a distributed data store that uses RDMA on
it. The use of FlashNet’s RDMA API improves the performance of KV store by 2x, and requires minimum changes
for the ported data store to access remote flash devices.
