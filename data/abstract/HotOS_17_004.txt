has put strain on the Linux kernelâ€™s abstractions. After years of
having its abstractions bypassed via virtualization, the kernel has
responded with a native container abstraction that is eagerly being
applied in the cloud. In this paper, we point out that history is repeating itself: with the introduction of serverless computing, even
the native container abstraction is ill-suited. We show that bypassing the kernel with unikernels can yield at least a factor of 6 better
latency and throughput. Facing a more complex kernel than ever
and a relatively undemanding computing model, we must revisit
the question of whether the kernel should try to adapt, we should
continue bypassing the kernel, or if it is finally time to try a new
native OS for this important future cloud workload.
