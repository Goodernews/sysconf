
Cloud virtualization technology is shifting towards
light-weight containers, which provide isolated environments
for running cloud-based services. The emerging trends such as
container-based micro-service architectures and hybrid cloud
deployments result in increased traffic volumes between the
micro-services, mobility of the communication endpoints, and
some of the communication taking place over untrusted networks. Yet, the services are typically designed with the assumption of scalable, persistent and secure connectivity. In this
paper, we present the SynAPTIC architecture, which enables
secure and persistent connectivity between mobile containers,
especially in the hybrid cloud and in multi-tenant cloud networks. The solution is based on the standardized Host Identity
Protocol (HIP) that tenants can deploy on top of existing cloud
infrastructure independently of their cloud provider. Optional
cloud-provider extensions based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) further optimize the networking architecture. Our
qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that SynAPTIC
performs better than some of the existing solutions.
