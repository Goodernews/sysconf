on supercomputers that comprise hundreds to thousands of
species at the whole-transcriptome or whole-genome level. The
phylogenetic likelihood function (PLF) consumes 90-95% of
total execution time in such analyses and is therefore typically
parallelized. Recently, the site repeats (SR) technique for substantially accelerating the PLF has been introduced. It identifies
repeating patterns in parts of the likelihood computation and
omits the respective redundant calculations to save time and
space. However, the SR technique induces a parallel load imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel randomized data
distribution algorithm to improve load balance (RDDA) for SRbased likelihood calculations. The algorithm is available as opensource code, induces minimal run-time overhead, and yields up
to 25% run time improvements on empirical datasets and up
to 50% for a synthetic, worst-case scenario. This improvement
is substantial as current evolutionary data analyses may require
tens of millions of core hours on supercomputer systems.
