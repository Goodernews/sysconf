
There has been a 10,000-fold increase in performance of supercomputers since 1992 but only 300-fold improvement in performance per watt. Dynamic adaptation of hardware
techniques such as fine-grain clock gating, power gating and
dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, are used for many years
to improve the computerâ€™s energy efficiency. However, recent
demands of exascale computation, as well as the increasing
carbon footprint, require new breakthrough to make ICT systems
more energy efficient. Energy efficient software has not been
well studied in the last decade. In this paper, we take an
early step to investigate the energy efficiency of Java which is
one of the most common languages used in ICT systems. We
evaluate energy consumption of data types, operators, control
statements, exception, and object in Java at a granular level. Intel
Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) technology is applied to
measure the relative power consumption of small code snippets.
Several observations are found, and these results will help in
standardizing the energy consumption traits of Java which can
be leveraged by software developers to generate energy efficient
code in future.
