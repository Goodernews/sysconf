
The increasingly growing data sets processed on
HPC platforms raise major challenges for the underlying storage
layer. A promising alternative to POSIX-IO- compliant file
systems are simpler blobs (binary large objects), or object storage
systems. They offer lower overhead and better performance
at the cost of largely unused features such as file hierarchies
or permissions. Similarly, blobs are increasingly considered for
replacing distributed file systems for big data analytics or as a
base for storage abstractions like key-value stores or time-series
databases. This growing interest in such object storage on HPC
and big data platforms raises the question: Are blobs the right
level of abstraction to enable storage-based convergence between
HPC and Big Data? In this paper we take a first step towards
answering the question by analyzing the applicability of blobs
for both platforms.
