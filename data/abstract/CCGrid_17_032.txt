
A large number of cloud datastores have been
developed to handle the cloud OLTP workload. Double caching
problem where the same data resides both at the user buffer
and the kernel buffer has been identified as one of the problems
and has been largely solved by using direct I/O mode to bypass
the kernel buffer. However, maintaining the caching layer only
in user-level has the disadvantage that the user process may
monopolize memory resources and that it is difficult to fully
utilize the system memory due to the risks of the forced
termination of the process or the unpredictable performance
degradation in case of memory pressure.

In this paper, we propose a new I/O mode, DBIO, to
efficiently exploit OS kernel buffer as a victim cache for userlevel file content cache, enjoying the strengths of kernel-level
cache rather than just skipping it. DBIO provides the new
file read/write function calls, which enable user programs to
dynamically choose the right I/O behavior based on their
context when issuing I/Os instead of when opening the file. On
the cloud key-value store workloads and the traditional OLTP
workloads with the modified version of MySQL/InnoDB, DBIO
improves the in-memory cache hit ratio and the transaction
performance compared to both buffered and direct I/O mode,
fully utilizing the user buffer and the kernel buffer without
double caching.
