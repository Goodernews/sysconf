technologies can provide both data persistence and high performance at memory level. The design of existing file systems
for NVMM has to handle the data durability problem between
CPU cache and NVMM. However, most NVMM-aware file
systems could not meet the strong data consistency requirement
of applications with data structures, e.g. B-Tree. Traditional
techniques, such as copy-on-write and journaling, delivering data
consistency, have defects of write amplification and data copy,
respectively.

In this paper, we explore SNFS, one log-structured file system
with optimization of data consistency based-on non-volatile main
memory, providing high performance for applications with small
writes. Specifically, SNFS adopts a small data-log mechanism
to journal fine-grained data writes. It also uses in-place writes
to minimize memory footprint for small data updating and
accelerates data block locating with hashing strategy. Finally,
we evaluate SNFSâ€™s performance with several write-intensive
workloads, and experimental results show that SNFS improves
the system throughput by up to 23 times compared to state-of-theart file systems and reduces the execution time by up to 65.5%.
