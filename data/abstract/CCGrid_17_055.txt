
Fail-stop errors and Silent Data Corruptions
(SDCs) are the most common failure modes for High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. There are studies
that address fail-stop errors and studies that address SDCs.
However few studies address both types of errors together. In
this paper we propose a software-based selective replication
technique for HPC applications for both fail-stop errors and
SDCs. Since complete replication of applications can be costly
in terms of resources, we develop a runtime-based technique for
selective replication. Selective replication provides an opportunity to meet HPC reliability targets while decreasing resource
costs. Our technique is low-overhead, automatic and completely
transparent to the user.
