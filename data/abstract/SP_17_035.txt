
Embedded systems are ubiquitous in every aspect of
modern life. As the Internet of Thing expands, our dependence
on these systems increases. Many of these interconnected systems
are and will be low cost bare-metal systems, executing without an
operating system. Bare-metal systems rarely employ any security
protection mechanisms and their development assumptions (unrestricted access to all memory and instructions), and constraints
(runtime, energy, and memory) makes applying protections
challenging.

To address these challenges we present EPOXY, an LLVMbased embedded compiler. We apply a novel technique, called
privilege overlaying, wherein operations requiring privileged
execution are identified and only these operations execute in
privileged mode. This provides the foundation on which codeintegrity, adapted control-flow hijacking defenses, and protections for sensitive IO are applied. We also design fine-grained
randomization schemes, that work within the constraints of baremetal systems to provide further protection against control-flow
and data corruption attacks.

These defenses prevent code injection attacks and ROP attacks
from scaling across large sets of devices. We evaluate the
performance of our combined defense mechanisms for a suite of
75 benchmarks and 3 real-world IoT applications. Our results for
the application case studies show that EPOXY has, on average,
a 1.8% increase in execution time and a 0.5% increase in energy
usage.
