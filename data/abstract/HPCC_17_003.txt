
Recent interest in machine-learning based methods
has produced many sophisticated models for performance modeling and optimization. These models tend to be sensitive to
parameters of the underlying architecture and hence yield the
highest prediction accuracy when trained on the target platform.
Training a classifier, however, is a fairly involved process and requires knowledge of statistics and machine learning that the end
users of such models may not possess. This paper presents a new
framework for automatically generating machine-learning based
performance models. A tool-chain is developed that provides
automated mechanisms for sample generation, dynamic feature
extraction, feature selection, data labeling, validation and hyper
parameter tuning. We describe the design and implementation of
this system and demonstrate its efficacy by developing a learning
heuristic for register allocation in GPU kernels. Results show that
auto-generated models can predict register thresholds that lead to
integer factor performance improvements over kernels produced
by state-of-the-art optimizing compilers.
