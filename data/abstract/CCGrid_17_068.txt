
By massively adopting OpenStack for operating small to large private and public clouds, the industry
has made it one of the largest running software project,
overgrowing the Linux kernel. However, with success comes
increased complexity; facing technical and scientific challenges, developers are in great difficulty when testing the
impact of individual changes on the performance of such
a large codebase, which will likely slow down the evolution
of OpenStack. Thus, we claim it is now time for the
scientific community to join the effort and get involved
in the development of OpenStack, like it has been once
done for Linux.

In this spirit, we developed Enos, an integrated framework that relies on container technologies for deploying
and evaluating OpenStack on any testbed. Enos allows
researchers to easily express different configurations, enabling fine-grained investigations of OpenStack services.
Enos collects performance metrics at runtime and stores
them for post-mortem analysis and sharing. The relevance
of the Enos approach to reproducible research is illustrated by evaluating different OpenStack scenarios on the
Gridâ€™5000 testbed.
