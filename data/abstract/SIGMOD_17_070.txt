new ways to harness the performance opportunity of combining
different specialized concurrency control mechanisms (CCs) within
the same database. Tebaldi partitions conflicts at a fine granularity and
matches them to specialized CCs within a hierarchical framework
that is modular, extensible, and able to support a wide variety of
concurrency control techniques, from single-version to multiversion
and from lock-based to timestamp-based. When running the TPC-C
benchmark, Tebaldi yields more than 20 x the throughput of the basic
two-phase locking protocol, and over 3.7 x the throughput of Callas,
arecent system that, like Tebaldi, aims to combine different CCs.
