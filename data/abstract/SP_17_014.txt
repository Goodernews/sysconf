
This paper studies information flows via timing
channels in the presence of automatic memory management. We
construct a series of example attacks that illustrate that garbage
collectors form a shared resource that can be used to reliably
leak sensitive information at a rate of up to 1 byte/sec on a
contemporary general-purpose computer. The created channel is
also observable across a network connection in a datacenter-like
setting. We subsequently present a design of automatic memory
management that is provably resilient against such attacks.
