shorten communication time and completion time of cluster applications. However, existing frameworks only consider available
bandwidth on hosts and overlook congestion in the network
when making scheduling decisions. Through extensive simulations using the realistic workload probability distribution from
Facebook, we observe the performance degradation of the stateof-the-art coflow scheduling framework, Varys, in the cloud
environment on a shared data center network (DCN) because
of the lack of network congestion information. We propose
Coflourish, the first coflow scheduling framework that exploits
the congestion feedback assistances from the software-definednetworking(SDN)-enabled switches in the networks for available
bandwidth estimation. Our simulation results demonstrate that
Coflourish outperforms Varys by up to 75.5% in terms
of average coflow completion time under various workload
conditions. The proposed work also reveals the potentials of
integration with traffic engineering mechanisms in lower levels
for further performance optimization.
