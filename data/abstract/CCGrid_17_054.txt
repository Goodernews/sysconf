a huge amount of log data. Exploring various potential correlations of fatal events is crucial for understanding their causality
and improving the working efficiency for system administrators. To this end, we developed a toolkit, named LogAider,
that can reveal three types of potential correlations: acrossfield, spatial, and temporal. Across-field correlation refers to
the statistical correlation across fields within a log or across
multiple logs based on probabilistic analysis. For analyzing
the spatial correlation of events, we developed a generic, easyto-use visualizer that can view any events queried by users
on a system machine graph. LogAider can also mine spatial
correlations by an optimized K-meaning clustering algorithm
over a Torus network topology. It is also able to disclose the
temporal correlations (or error propagations) over a certain
period inside a log or across multiple logs, based on an effective
similarity analysis strategy. We assessed LogAider using the
one-year reliability-availability-serviceability (RAS) log of Mira
system (one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers), as
well as its job log. We find that LogAider very helpful for
revealing the potential correlations of fatal system events and
job events, with an accurate mining of across-field correlation
with both precision and recall of 99.9-100%, as well as precise
detection of temporal-correlation with a high similarity (up to
95%) to the ground-truth.
