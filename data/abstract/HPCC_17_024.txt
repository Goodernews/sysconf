
in big cities around the world air pollution is reaching harmful levels. One of the reasons for air contamination is the
automotive emissions. Soft appeals by the authorities to the citizens did not change much of the situation. Many people use the car
in everyday activities, e.g. going to work or every day food shopping in supermarkets. Recent studies showed that a replacement
of the current vehicles through autonomous vehicles would help in
reducing these emissions. A radical replacement is not possible.
The actual infrastructure needs to be extended by technologies
that facilitate autonomous driving. Therefor integration of knowhow from other domains like internet of things, big data analysis
or transportation planning has to be considered. This paper presents a smart service where, based on the information provided by
principals of industry 4.0 and internet of things, the planning of an
autonomous grocery delivery fleet occurs. This service is implemented then at a smaller scale, as an autonomous ordering and
delivery system for coffees, and realised at the Heilbronn University. Furthermore, the paper presents the benefits and the limitations of this kind of system.
