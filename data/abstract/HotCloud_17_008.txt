computing services scale up services at the granularity
of whole VMs. In this paper, we observe that GPU workloads underutilize GPU device memory, leading us to
explore the benefits of reallocating heterogeneous GPUs
within existing VMs. We outline approaches for upgrading and downgrading GPUs for OpenCL GPGPU workloads, and show how to minimize the chance of cloud operator VM termination by maximizing the heterogeneous
environments in which applications can run.
