
Drive-Managed SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) disks
offer a plug-compatible higher-capacity replacement for
conventional disks. For non-sequential workloads, these
disks show bimodal behavior: After a short period of high
throughput they enter a continuous period of low throughput.

We introduce ext4-lazy', a small change to the Linux
ext4 file system that significantly improves the throughput
in both modes. We present benchmarks on four different
drive-managed SMR disks from two vendors, showing that
ext4-lazy achieves 1.7-5.4x improvement over ext4 on a
metadata-light file server benchmark. On metadata-heavy
benchmarks it achieves 2-13 improvement over ext4 on
drive-managed SMR disks as well as on conventional disks.
