distributed, and span an entire wide area network (WAN). Today,
typically, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are deployed at enterprise scale and cannot handle attacks that cover a WAN. Moreover,
such IDSs are implemented at a single entity that expects to look
at all packets to determine an intrusion. Transferring copies of raw
packets to centralized engines for analysis in a WAN can significantly impact both network performance and detection accuracy. In
this paper, we propose Jaal, a framework for achieving accurate network intrusion detection at scale. The key idea in Jaal is to monitor
traffic and construct in-network packet summaries. The summaries
are then processed centrally to detect attacks with high accuracy.
The main challenges that we address are (a) creating summaries
that are concise, but sufficient to draw highly accurate inferences
and (b) transforming traditional IDS rules to handle summaries
instead of raw packets. We implement Jaal on a large scale SDN
testbed. We show that on average Jaal yields a detection accuracy
of about 98%, which is the highest reported for ISP scale network
intrusion detection. At the same time, the overhead associated with
transferring summaries to the central inference engine is only about
35% of what is consumed if raw packets are transferred.
