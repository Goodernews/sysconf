
With increasing memory footprints and working set
sizes of emerging workloads, system designers need to evaluate
new memory hierarchies with large last level caches (LLCs),
DRAM caches, large DRAMs, etc. to optimize performance
gains. This requires a deep understanding of the memory access
behavior of the target workloads. It is important to have accurate
mechanisms to generate address streams to study memory access
behavior at and beyond LLCs. Prior memory trace generation
proposals such as WEST and STM utilize LRU stack distance to
capture temporal locality in the data access streams. In addition,
STM also captures spatial locality information by modeling
stride-based access patterns. However, a key drawback of prior
models is that the metadata that they store to capture locality is
significantly high.

In this paper, we propose an efficient, light-weight methodology to generate accurate traces for modeling address Streams
for LLC And Beyond (SLAB). SLAB leverages the key insight
that memory access patterns can be efficiently characterized
by combining locality and reuse statistics captured from both
instruction and address streams. Compared to prior studies,
which capture patterns solely based on data addresses, using the
additional instruction stream localized information significantly
reduces the space complexity. For programs where dominant
instruction-localized patterns do not exist, SLAB exploits multigranularity data reuse distances. We evaluate SLAB using SPEC
CPU2006 and Cloudsuite benchmarks. With meta-data sizes of
less than 7% of the original LLC traces, SLAB demonstrates over
91% accuracy in replicating original application behavior across
~9000 different cache, prefetcher and memory configurations.
