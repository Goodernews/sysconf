cloud runtimes. This is primarily because they started
their journey in IaaS clouds, running on a guestOS inside
VMs. Then to increase performance, many guestOSes
have been paravirtualized making them virtualization
aware, so that they can bypass some of the virtualization layers, as in virtio. This approach still kept applications unmodified. Recently, we are witnessing a rapid
adoption of containers due to their packaging benefits,
high density, fast start-up and low overhead. Applications are increasingly being on-boarded to PaaS clouds
in the form of application containers or appc, where
they are run directly on a cloud substrate like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. This shift in deployment practices present an opportunity to make applications aware
of their cloud. In this paper, we present Paracloud framework for application containers and discuss the Paracloud interface (PaCI) for three cloud operations namely
migration, auto-scaling and load-balancing.
