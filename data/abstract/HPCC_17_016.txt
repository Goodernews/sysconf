
 Recently, mobile phone call detail records (CDR)
have been used to study mobility patterns in cities. Since home and
workplace are the most important places in peopleâ€™s lives and
define the structure and activity patterns of the city, identifying
home and work locations and home-work commuting patterns are
of much interest. However, due to decreasing usage of voice calls
and SMS, and low usage while people staying at home, identifying
home and work locations are getting more difficult. In this paper,
we develop a method to exploit daily-aggregated internet usage
data (G-CDR) in addition to CDR for identifying work locations.
We also develop a method for identifying home locations based on
detecting sleeping time. This method can significantly increase
home detection success rate and accuracy. From the identified
home and work locations, we have explored the population
distribution and commuting patterns of people in Bangkok.
