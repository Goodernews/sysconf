finding resource-usage side-channel vulnerabilities in Java applications. We introduce the notion of e-bounded non-interference,
a variant and relaxation of Goguen and Meseguerâ€™s well-known
non-interference principle. We then present Quantitative Cartesian
Hoare Logic (QCHL), a program logic for verifying e-bounded noninterference. Our tool, THEMIS, combines automated reasoning in
CHL with lightweight static taint analysis to improve scalability.
We evaluate THEMIs on well known Java applications and demonstrate that THEMIs can find unknown side-channel vulnerabilities
in widely-used programs. We also show that THEMIs can verify
the absence of vulnerabilities in repaired versions of vulnerable
programs and that THEMIs compares favorably against BLAZER, a
state-of-the-art static analysis tool for finding timing side channels
in Java applications.
