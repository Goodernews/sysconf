
. To deploy a distributed application on the cloud, cost,
resource and communication constraints have to be considered to select
the most suitable Virtual Machines (VMs), from private and public cloud
providers. This process becomes very complex in large scale scenarios
and, as this problem is NP-Hard, its automation must take scalability
into consideration. In this work, we propose a heuristic able to calculate
initial placements for distributed component-based applications on possibly multiple clouds with the objective of minimizing VM renting costs
while satisfying applicationsâ€™ resource and communication constraints.
We evaluate the heuristic performance and determine its limitations by
comparing it to other placement approaches, namely exact algorithms
and meta-heuristics. We show that the proposed heuristic is able to compute a good solution much faster than them.
