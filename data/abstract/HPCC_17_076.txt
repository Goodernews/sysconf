
Position prediction of moving object has become a
reality utilizing the vast amount of location data acquired by
positioning devices embedded in mobile phones and cars. In this
paper, we proposed a position prediction system which focuses on
the time regularity of object moving. Historical location data of the
object is used to extract personal trajectory patterns to obtain
candidate next positions. Each of the candidate positions is scored
by the proposed Time Mode-based Prediction (TMP) algorithm
according to the proximity between the time component of
patterns and current time. The position with the highest score is
regarded as predicted next position. Furthermore, a hybrid B/S
and C/S architecture is employed to perform the real-time
prediction and results display. An evaluation based on a public
trajectory data set of 12 objects demonstrates that the proposed
TMP algorithm can realize position prediction with high accuracy.
Moreover, the average accuracy rate of our prediction algorithm
is about 85.5%, which is 33.7% greater than the Markov-based
algorithm with one known position.
