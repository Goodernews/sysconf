
Encrypted databases, a popular approach to protecting data from
compromised database management systems (DBMS’s), use abstract
threat models that capture neither realistic databases, nor realistic
attack scenarios. In particular, the “snapshot attacker” model used to
support the security claims for many encrypted databases does not
reflect the information about past queries available in any snapshot
attack on an actual DBMS.

We demonstrate how this gap between theory and reality causes
encrypted databases to fail to achieve their “provable security”
guarantees.
