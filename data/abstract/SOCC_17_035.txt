However, due to the sensitive nature of data, many organizations
are reluctant to analyze their data in public clouds. Both softwarebased and hardware-based solutions have been proposed to address
the stalemate, yet all have substantial limitations. We observe that
a main issue cutting across all solutions is that they attempt to support confidentiality in data queries in a way transparent to queries.
We propose the novel abstraction of secure data types with corresponding annotations for programmers to conveniently denote
constraints relevant to security. These abstractions are leveraged by
novel compilation techniques in our system Cuttlefish to compute
data analytics queries in public cloud infrastructures while keeping
sensitive data confidential. Cuttlefish encrypts all sensitive data
residing in the cloud and employs partially homomorphic encryption schemes to perform operations securely, resorting however to
client-side completion, re-encryption, or secure hardware-based
re-encryption based on Intelâ€™s SGX when available based on a novel
planner engine. Our evaluation shows that our prototype can execute all queries in standard benchmarks such as TPC-H and TPC-DS
with an average overhead of 2.34x and 1.69x respectively compared
to a plaintext execution that reveals all data.
