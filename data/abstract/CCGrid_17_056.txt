enabling fast data analytics by leveraging system capabilities
from large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
OpenSHMEM is a popular run-time system on HPC systems
that has been used for large-scale compute-intensive scientific
applications. In this paper, we propose to leverage OpenSHMEM
to design a distributed in-memory key-value store for fast data
analytics. Accordingly, we have developed SHMEMCache on
top of OpenSHMEM to leverage its symmetric global memory,
efficient one-sided communication operations and general portability. We have also evaluated SHMEMCache through extensive
experimental studies. Our results show that SHMEMCache has
accomplished significant performance improvements over hte
original Memcached in terms of latency and throughput. Our
evaluation on the Titan supercomputer has also demonstrated
that SHMEMCache can scale to 1024 nodes.
