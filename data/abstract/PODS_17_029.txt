be intractable in many cases, even in data complexity, i.e.,
when the query is fixed. Although some restrictions of the
queries [20] and instances [4] have been proposed to lower
the complexity, these known tractable cases usually do not
apply to combined complexity, i-e., when the query is not
fixed. This leaves open the question of which query and
instance languages ensure the tractability of probabilistic
query evaluation in combined complexity.

This paper proposes the first general study of the combined
complexity of conjunctive query evaluation on probabilistic
instances over binary signatures, which we can alternatively
phrase as a probabilistic version of the graph homomorphism problem, or of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)
variant. We study the complexity of this problem depending on whether instances and queries can use features such
as edge labels, disconnectedness, branching, and edges in
both directions. We show that the complexity landscape is
surprisingly rich, using a variety of technical tools: automatabased compilation to d-DNNF lineages as in [4], 8-acyclic lineages using [11], the X-property for tractable CSP from [25],
graded DAGs [28] and various coding techniques for hardness
proofs.
