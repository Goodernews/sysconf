
We present a multi-word atomic (1,N) register
for multi-core machines exploiting Read-Modify-Write (RMW)
instructions to coordinate the writer and the readers in a waitfree manner. Our proposal, called Anonymous Readers Counting (ARC), enables large-scale data sharing by admitting up
to 2°? — 2 concurrent readers on off-the-shelf 64-bit machines,
as opposed to the most advanced RMW-based approach which
is limited to 58 readers. Further, ARC avoids multiple copies
of the register content while accessing it—this affects classical
register’s algorithms based on atomic read/write operations
on single words. Thus, ARC allows for higher scalability with
respect to the register size.
