
. De novo genome assembly is one of the most important
and challenging computational problems in modern genomics; further, it
shares algorithms and communication patterns important to other graph
analytic and irregular applications. Unlike simulations, it has no floating point arithmetic and is dominated by small memory transactions
within and between computing nodes. In this work, we focus on the
highly scalable HipMer assembler and identify the dominant algorithms
and communication patterns, also using microbenchmarks to capture the
workload. We evaluate HipMer on a variety of platforms from the latest HPC systems to ethernet clusters. HipMer performs well on all single
node systems, including the Xeon Phi manycore architecture. Given large
enough problems, it also demonstrates excellent scaling across nodes in
an HPC system, but requires a high speed network with low overhead
and high injection rates. Our results shed light on the architectural features that are most important for achieving good parallel efficiency on
this and related problems.
