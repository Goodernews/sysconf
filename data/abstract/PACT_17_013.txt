
Achieving system fairness is a major design concern in current multicore processors. Unfairness arises due to
contention in the shared resources of the system, such as the
LLC and main memory. To address this problem, many research
works have proposed novel cache partitioning policies aimed
at addressing system fairness without harming performance.
Unfortunately, existing proposals targeting fairness require extra
hardware which makes them impractical in commercial processors.

Recent Intel Xeon processors feature Cache Allocation Technology (CAT), a hardware cache partitioning mechanism that can
be controlled from userspace software and that allows to create
partitions in the LLC and assign different groups of applications
to them.

In this paper we propose a family of clustering-based cache
partitioning policies to address fairness in systems that feature
Intelâ€™s CAT. The proposal acts at two levels: applications showing
similar amount of core stalls due to LLC accesses are first
grouped into clusters, after which each cluster is given a number
of ways using a simple mathematical model. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to address system fairness
using the cache partitioning hardware in a real product. Results
show that our best performing policy reduces system unfairness
by up to 80% (39% on average) for 8-application workloads and
by up to 45% (25% on average) for 12-application workloads
compared to a non-partitioning approach.
