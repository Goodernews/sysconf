
There is a consensus that exascale systems should operate within a
power envelope of 20MW. Consequently, energy conservation is
still considered as the most crucial constraint if such systems are
to be realized.

So far, most research on this topic focused on strategies such as
power capping and dynamic power management. Although these
approaches can reduce power consumption, we believe that they
might not be sufficient to reach the exascale energy-efficiency goals.
Hence, we aim to adopt techniques from embedded systems, where
energy-efficiency has always been the fundamental objective.

A successful energy-saving technique used in embedded systems is to integrate fine-grained autotuning with dynamic voltage
and frequency scaling. In this paper, we apply a similar technique
to a real-world HPC application. Our experimental results on a
HPC cluster indicate that such an approach saves up to 20% of
energy compared to the baseline configuration, with negligible
performance loss.
