due to a lack of flexible load balancing mechanisms and
passively launched degraded reads when the original
storage node of the requested data becomes a hotspot.
We provide a new perspective to load balancing in coded
storage systems by proactively and intelligently launching degraded reads and propose a variety of schemes
to make optimal decisions either per request or across
requests statistically. Experiments on a 98-machine cluster based on the request traces of 12 million objects collected from Windows Azure Storage (WAS) show that
our schemes can reduce the median latency by 44.7%
and the 95th-percentile tail latency by 77.8% in coded
storage systems.
