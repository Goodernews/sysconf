
As GPUs become more pervasive in both scalable
high-performance computing systems and safety-critical embedded systems, evaluating and analyzing their resilience to
soft errors caused by high-energy particle strikes will grow
increasingly important. GPU designers must develop tools
and techniques to understand the effect of these soft errors
on applications. This paper presents an error injection-based
methodology and tool called SASSIFI to study the soft error
resilience of massively parallel applications running on stateof-the-art NVIDIA GPUs. Our approach uses a low-level
assembly-language instrumentation tool called SASSI to profile
and inject errors. SASSI provides efficiency by allowing instrumentation code to execute entirely on the GPU and provides
the ability to inject into different architecture-visible state.
For example, SASSIFI can inject errors in general-purpose
registers, GPU memory, condition code registers, and predicate
registers. SASSIFI can also inject errors into addresses and
register indices. In this paper, we describe the SASSIFI tool,
its capabilities, and present experiments to illustrate some of
the analyses SASSIFI can be used to perform.
