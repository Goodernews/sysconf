
That the sum of guarantees on bandwidth for any
link should be smaller than the link capacity, a prerequisite
of offering bandwidth guarantees for tenants in the cloud, is
satisfied by virtual machine placement algorithms. The current
ones, however, either know nothing about bandwidth guarantees
or employ a coarse-grained model for resource abstraction. To
solve the problem, this paper first proposes a fine-grained virtual
machine placement algorithm which is formulated as a nonlinear
program of which the objective is to minimize the number of
physical machines used. Specifically, apart from constraints for
server resources, we add an additional one for each link to ensure
the sum of offered guarantees for each of those links is not greater
than its capacity. Further, we devise a heuristic algorithm to
address the nonlinear programming problem. Through extensive
simulations, we show that our approach is cost-effective, which
can reduce the number of physical machines required by 26.17%
on average compared with the most recent one.
