
We consider the following balls-into-bins process
with n bins and m balls: Each ball is equipped with a mutually
independent exponential clock of rate 1. Whenever a ball’s
clock rings, the ball samples a random bin and moves there if
the number of balls in the sampled bin is smaller than in its
current bin.

This simple process models a typical load balancing problem where users (balls) seek a selfish improvement of their
assignment to resources (bins). From a game theoretic perspective, this is a randomized approach to the well-known KPmodel [1], while it is known as Randomized Local Search
(RLS) in load balancing literature [2], [3]. Up to now, the
best bound on the expected time to reach perfect balance was
O((Inn)? + In(n) - n?/m) due to [3]. We improve this to
an asymptotically tight O(In(n) + n?/m). Our analysis is
based on the crucial observation that performing destructive
moves (reversals of RLS moves) cannot decrease the balancing
time. This allows us to simplify problem instances and to ignore
“inconvenient moves” in the analysis.
