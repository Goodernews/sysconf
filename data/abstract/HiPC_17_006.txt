
The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility
(OLCF) runs Titan, the No. 4 supercomputer in the world, to
deliver over four billion compute core hours every year to several
scientific domains, in their pursuit of leadership science. In this
paper, we analyze four years worth of heterogeneous log data
sources from the OLCF resource fabric, capturing metadata
on entities such as users (2,546), scientific project allocations
(674), jobs (1,352,402) and publications (1,146), to derive insights
into the trends in core hour usage and publications, across
35 science domains. We have constructed a scalable graph to
represent the OLCF entities and apply rich graph analytics for
our analysis. Based on this, we have analyzed the metadata
across five dimensions, namely (1) quantitative analysis of Titan
system usage, (2) quantitative analysis of OLCF publications, (3)
correlation analysis between system usage and publications, (4)
text analysis to derive OLCF research trends, and (5) utilization
of graph mining for association analysis. To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to apply graphbased big data techniques to provide comprehensive insights
on an HPC center’s core hour usage and users’ publication
trends. Our results provide valuable details into an HPC center’s
core allocation program, measuring the productivity of scientific
domains, the interplay between core usage and research output,
accelerating collaboration, and in predicting new connections
between resource entities.
