
Burst Buffer is an effective solution for reducing
the data transfer time and the I/O interference in HPC systems.
Extending Burst Buffers (BBs) to handle Big Data applications is
challenging because BBs must account for the large data inputs
of Big Data applications and the performance guarantees of HPC
applications - which are considered as first-class citizens in HPC
systems. Existing BBs focus on only intermediate data of Big
Data applications and incur a high performance degradation
of both Big Data and HPC applications. We present Eley, a
burst buffer solution that helps to accelerate the performance
of Big Data applications while guaranteeing the performance
of HPC applications. In order to improve the performance of
Big Data applications, Eley employs a prefetching technique that
fetches the input data of these applications to be stored close to
computing nodes thus reducing the latency of reading data inputs.
Moreover, Eley is equipped with a full delay operator to guarantee
the performance of HPC applications - as they are running
independently on a HPC system. The experimental results show
the effectiveness of Eley in obtaining shorter execution time of
Big Data applications (shorter map phase) while guaranteeing
the performance of HPC applications.
