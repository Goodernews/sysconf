
Taking advantage of recently released hybrid multicore architectures, such as the Intel Xeon+FPGA machine, where the FPGA
has coherent access to the main memory through the QPI bus, we
explore the benefits of specializing operators to hardware. We focus on two commonly used SQL operators for strings: LIKE, and
REGEXP_LIKE, and provide a novel and efficient implementation of these operators in reconfigurable hardware. We integrate
the hardware accelerator into MonetDB, a main-memory column
store, and demonstrate a significant improvement in response time
and throughput. Our Hardware User Defined Function (HUDF)
can speed up complex pattern matching by an order of magnitude
in comparison to the database running on a 10-core CPU. The insights gained from integrating hardware based string operators into
MonetDB should also be useful for future designs combining hardware specialization and databases.
