
The performance of 3D rendering of Graphics
Processing Unit that converts 3D vector stream into 2D frame
with 3D image effects significantly impacts users gaming
experience on modern computer systems. Due to its high
texture throughput requirement, main memory bandwidth
becomes a critical obstacle for improving the overall rendering
performance. 3D-stacked memory systems such as Hybrid
Memory Cube provide opportunities to significantly overcome
the memory wall by directly connecting logic controllers to
DRAM dies. Although recent works have shown promising
improvement in performance by utilizing HMC to accelerate
special-purpose applications, a critical challenge of how to
effectively leverage its high internal bandwidth and computing
capability in GPU for 3D rendering remains unresolved. Based
on the observation that texel fetches greatly impact off-chip
memory traffic, we propose two architectural designs to enable
Processing-In-Memory based GPU for efficient 3D rendering.
Additionally, we employ camera angles of pixels to control
the performance-quality tradeoff of 3D rendering. Extensive
evaluation across several real-world games demonstrates that
our design can significantly improve the performance of texture
filtering and 3D rendering by an average of 3.97X (up to 6.4X)
and 43% (up to 65%) respectively, over the baseline GPU.
Meanwhile, our design provides considerable memory traffic
and energy reduction without sacrificing rendering quality.
