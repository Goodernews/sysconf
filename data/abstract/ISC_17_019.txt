
. With the growing complexity and scale of high performance computing (HPC) systems, application performance variation has
become a significant challenge in efficient and resilient system management. Application performance variation can be caused by resource contention as well as software- and firmware-related problems, and can lead
to premature job termination, reduced performance, and wasted compute
platform resources. To effectively alleviate this problem, system administrators must detect and identify the anomalies that are responsible for
performance variation and take preventive actions. However, diagnosing
anomalies is often a difficult task given the vast amount of noisy and
high-dimensional data being collected via a variety of system monitoring
infrastructures.

In this paper, we present a novel framework that uses machine learning
to automatically diagnose previously encountered performance anomalies
in HPC systems. Our framework leverages resource usage and performance counter data collected during application runs. We first convert
the collected time series data into statistical features that retain application characteristics to significantly reduce the computational overhead of
our technique. We then use machine learning algorithms to learn anomaly
characteristics from this historical data and to identify the types of anomalies observed while running applications. We evaluate our framework
both on an HPC cluster and on a public cloud, and demonstrate that
our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in detecting anomalies, reaching an F-score over 0.97.
