
We present the design and implementation of a
parallel and fully algebraic preconditioner based on an approximate sparse factorization using low-rank matrix compression.
The sparse factorization uses a multifrontal algorithm with fill-in
occurring in dense frontal matrices. These frontal matrices are
approximated as hierarchically semi-separable matrices, which
are constructed using a randomized sampling technique. The
resulting preconditioner has (close to) optimal complexity in
terms of flops and memory usage for many discretized partial
differential equations. We illustrate the robustness and performance of this new preconditioner for a number of unstructured
grid problems. Initial results show that the rank-structured
preconditioner could be a viable alternative to algebraic multigrid
and incomplete LU, for instance. Our implementation uses MPI
and OpenMP and supports real and complex arithmetic and 32
and 64 bit integers. We present a detailed performance analysis.
The code is released as the STRUMPACK library with a BSD
license, and a PETSc interface is available to allow for easy
integration in existing applications.
