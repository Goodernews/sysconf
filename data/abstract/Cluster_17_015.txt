
 The increase in memory capacity is substantially behind the increase in computing power in todayâ€™s supercomputers.
In order to alleviate the effect of this gap, diverse options such as
NVM - non-volatile memory (less expensive but slow) and HBM high bandwidth memory (fast but expensive) are being explored.
In this paper, we present a common approach using parallel
runtime techniques for utilizing NVM and HBM as extensions of
the existing memory hierarchy. We evaluate our approach using
matrix-matrix multiplication kernel implemented in CHARM++
and show that applications with memory requirement four times
the HBM/DRAM capacity can be executed efficiently using
significantly less total resources.
