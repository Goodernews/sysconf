
. Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) is a well-studied graph
problem. Examples of SSSP algorithms include the original Dijkstraâ€™s
algorithm and the parallel A-stepping and KLA-SSSP algorithms. In
this paper, we use a novel Abstract Graph Machine (AGM) model to
show that all these algorithms share a common logic and differ from one
another by the order in which they perform work. We use the AGM
model to thoroughly analyze the family of algorithms that arises from
the common logic. We start with the basic algorithm without any ordering (Chaotic), and then we derive the existing and new algorithms by
methodically exploring semantic and spatial ordering of work. Our experimental results show that new derived algorithms show better performance than the existing distributed memory parallel algorithms, especially at higher scales.
