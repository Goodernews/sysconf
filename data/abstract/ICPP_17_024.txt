
Modern distributed storage systems often store
redundant data in multiple replications or erasure coding
according to their access frequencies. Multiple replications
scheme is well-performance for hot data while erasure coding
scheme is storage-efficient for warm and cold data. When hot
data turn cold, an encoding procedure starts to do the conversion. However, due to sequential striping, current conversion
methods do not perform well for different data layouts, and
cause risky blocks and expensive network consumption.

In this paper, we propose Sice, a new encoder which deploys
non-sequential striping. It constructs non-sequential stripes
according to the data layout, performs conversion quickly with
low overheads and ends to no reduction of system reliability.
The results of both simulation and evaluation show that
Sice gains almost the same good performance for different
data layouts and has a great scalability. Sice helps HDFSRAID reduce network consumption by about 65% and reduce
influence on concurrent I/O-intensive applications by about
60%.
