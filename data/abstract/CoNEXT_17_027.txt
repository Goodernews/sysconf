is to deploy redundant instances. Unfortunately, such redundancy
efforts can be undermined if the application’s instances share common dependencies. This paper presents RECLOUD, a novel system
that can efficiently find a reliable deployment plan for cloud applications. RECLOUD considers and avoids common dependencies shared
across application instances that may lead to correlated failures, and
works with applications that even have complex internal structures.
RECLOUD utilizes various pieces of available dependency information (e.g., hardware, software and/or network dependencies) about
the cloud infrastructure to quantitatively assess the reliability of
the application’s deployment plan with rigorous error bounds. This
assessment further enables RECLOuD to find a deployment plan that
balances between reliability and other criteria such as application
performance and resource utilization. We implemented a fully functional system. The experimental results show that, even in a large
cloud environment with more than 27K hosts, RECLoUD needs only
30 seconds to find a deployment plan that is one order of magnitude
more reliable than the common practice.
