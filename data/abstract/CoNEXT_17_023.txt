based reachability and access control list based security policies. However, QoS policies as well as dynamic policies are
also important and not representing them in the high level
policy abstraction poses serious limitations. At the same
time, efficiently configuring and composing group based QoS
and dynamic policies present significant technical challenges,
such as (a) maintaining group granularity during configuration, (b) dealing with network-bandwidth contention among
policies from distinct writers and (c) dealing with multiple
path changes corresponding to dynamically changing policies,
group membership and end-point mobility. In this paper we
propose JANUS, a system which makes two major contributions. First, we extend the prior policy graph abstraction
model to represent complex QoS and dynamic stateful/temporal policies. Second, we convert the policy configuration
problem into an optimization problem with the goal of mazimizing the number of satisfied and configured policies, and
minimizing the number of path changes under dynamic environments. To solve this, JANUS presents several novel heuristic
algorithms. We evaluate our system using a diverse set of
bandwidth policies and network topologies. Our experiments
demonstrate that JANUS can achieve near-optimal solutions
in a reasonable amount of time.
