
Multicast communication constrained by endto-end delay and inter-destination delay variation is known
as Delay and Delay Variation Bounded Multicast (DVBM).
These constraints make the multicast communication realtime. In this paper, we propose a multi-core multicast
approach to solve the DVBM problem. The proposed threephase algorithm, Multi-core DVBM Trees (MWCDVBMT),
semi-matches group members to core nodes. The message
is disseminated to group members using trees rooted at the
designated core nodes. Simulation results show that when
existing single-core based algorithms fail to construct a
tree satisfying both constraints, MCDVBMT succeeds using
multiple cores with better inter-destination delay variation
and traffic concentration. However, the cost and the endto-end delay of the communication is higher than that of
single-core algorithms.
