
The past ten years has seen increasing calls to make
security research more “scientific”. On the surface, most agree
that this is desirable, given universal recognition of “science” as a
positive force. However, we find that there is little clarity on what
“scientific” means in the context of computer security research,
or consensus on what a “Science of Security” should look like. We
selectively review work in the history and philosophy of science
and more recent work under the label “Science of Security”.
We explore what has been done under the theme of relating
science and security, put this in context with historical science,
and offer observations and insights we hope may motivate further
exploration and guidance. Among our findings are that practices
on which the rest of science has reached consensus appear little
used or recognized in security, and a pattern of methodological
errors continues unaddressed.

Index Terms—security research; science of security; history of
