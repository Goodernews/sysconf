components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected.
For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance
anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle
underlying faults, i.e., gray failure rather than fail-stop failure. In this
paper, we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production
cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences. We
also argue that a key feature of gray failure is differential observability: that the system’s failure detectors may not notice problems even
when applications are afflicted by them. This realization leads us to
believe that, to best deal with them, we should focus on bridging the
gap between different components’ perceptions of what constitutes
failure.
