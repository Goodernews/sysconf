workloads is a must for realizing promised reductions
in capital and operational expenses in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). However, workload heterogeneity and complex relationships between resources allocated to a VNF and the resulting capacity makes elastic resource flexing a challenging task. We propose an
NFV resource flexing system, ENVI, that uses a combination of VNF-level features and infrastructure-level
features to construct a machine-learning-based decision
engine for detecting resource flexing events. ENVI also
extracts the dependence relationship among VNFs in deployed Service Function Chains (SFCs) to carefully plan
the sequence of resource flexing steps upon scaling detection. We present preliminary results for the accuracy
of ENVIâ€™s resource flexing decision engine with two different VNFs, namely, the caching proxy Squid and the
intrusion detection system Suricata. Our preliminary results show that using a combination of features to train a
neural network model is a promising approach for scaling detection.
