non-uniform work distributions, large memory footprints, and
high memory bandwidth demands. To address these challenging demands, HPC systems are turning to many-core architectures that feature a large number of energy-efficient cores
backed by high-bandwidth memory. These features are exemplified in Intelâ€™s recent Knights Landing many-core processor
(KNL), which typically has 68 cores and 16GB of on-package
multi-channel DRAM (MCDRAM). This work investigates how
the novel architectural features offered by KNL can be used
in the context of decomposing sparse, unstructured tensors
using the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). The CPD
is used extensively to analyze large multi-way datasets arising
in various areas including precision healthcare, cybersecurity,
and e-commerce. Towards this end, we (i) develop problem
decompositions for the CPD which are amenable to hundreds
of concurrent threads while maintaining load balance and
low synchronization costs; and (ii) explore the utilization of
architectural features such as MCDRAM. Using one KNL
processor, our algorithm achieves up to 1.8x speedup over
a dual socket Intel Xeon system with 44 cores.
