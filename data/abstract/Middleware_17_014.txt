
Rivulet is a fault-tolerant distributed platform for running
smart-home applications; it can tolerate failures typical for
a home environment (e.g., link losses, network partitions,
sensor failures, and device crashes). In contrast to existing
cloud-centric solutions, which rely exclusively on a home
gateway device, Rivulet leverages redundant smart consumer
appliances (e.g., TVs, Refrigerators) to spread sensing and
actuation across devices local to the home, and avoids making the Smart-Home Hub a single point of failure. Rivulet
ensures event delivery in the presence of link loss, network
partitions and other failures in the home, to enable applications with reliable sensing in the case of sensor failures,
and event processing in the presence of device crashes. In
this paper, we present the design and implementation of
Rivulet, and evaluate its effective handling of failures in a
smart home.
