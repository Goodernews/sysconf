access her data without leaking her access patterns. Existing clientefficient ORAMs either achieve O(log N) client-server communication blowup without heavy computation, or O(1) blowup but
with expensive homomorphic encryptions. It has been shown that
O(log N) bandwidth blowup might not be practical for certain applications, while schemes with O(1) communication blowup incur
even more delay due to costly homomorphic operations.

In this paper, we propose a new distributed ORAM scheme referred to as Shamir Secret Sharing ORAM (S?ORAM), which achieves
O(1) client-server bandwidth blowup and O(1) blocks of client storage without relying on costly partial homomorphic encryptions.
S3ORAM harnesses Shamir Secret Sharing, tree-based ORAM structure and a secure multi-party multiplication protocol to eliminate
costly homomorphic operations and, therefore, achieves O(1) clientserver bandwidth blowup with a high computational efficiency. We
conducted comprehensive experiments to assess the performance
of S3ORAM and its counterparts on actual cloud environments,
and showed that S?7ORAM achieves three orders of magnitude lower
end-to-end delay compared to alternatives with O(1) client communication blowup (Onion-ORAM), while it is one order of magnitude
faster than Path-ORAM for a network with a moderate bandwidth
quality. We have released the implementation of SSORAM for further improvement and adaptation.
