
We present an abortable mutual exclusion algorithm for the cachecoherent (CC) model with atomic registers and CAS objects. The
algorithm has constant expected amortized RMR complexity in the
oblivious adversary model and is deterministically deadlock-free.
This is the first abortable mutual exclusion algorithm that achieves
o(log n/log log n) RMR complexity.
