
Application-level energy management is an important di-
mension of energy optimization. In this paper, we introduce
ENT, a novel programming language for enabling proactive
and adaptive mode-based energy management at the ap-
plication level. The proactive design allows programmers
to apply their application knowledge to energy manage-
ment, by characterizing the energy behavior of different
program fragments with modes. The adaptive design allows
such characterization to be delayed until run time, useful
for capturing dynamic program behavior dependent on pro-
gram states, configuration settings, external battery levels,
or CPU temperatures. The key insight is both proactiveness
and adaptiveness can be unified under a type system com-
bined with static typing and dynamic typing. ENT has been
implemented as an extension to Java, and successfully ported
to three energy-conscious platforms: an Intel-based laptop, a
Raspberry Pi, and an Android phone. Evaluation shows ENT
improves the programmability, debuggability, and energy ef-
ficiency of battery-aware and temperature-aware programs.
