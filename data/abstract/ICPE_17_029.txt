exist for over a decade, anecdotal evidence suggests unit testing of performance is not nearly as common as unit testing
of functionality. We examine this situation in a study of
GitHub projects written in Java, looking for occurrences of
performance evaluation code in common performance testing
frameworks. We quantify the use of such frameworks, identifying the most relevant performance testing approaches, and
describe how we adjust the design of our SPL performance
testing framework to follow these conclusions.
