
Improving single thread performance is a key challenge in modern microprocessors especially because the traditional approach of increasing clock frequency and deep pipelining
cannot be pushed further due to power constraints. Therefore,
researchers have been looking at unconventional architectures
to boost single thread performance without running into the
power wall. HW/SW co-designed processors like Nvidia Denver,
are emerging as a promising alternative.

However, HW/SW co-designed processors need to address
some key challenges such as startup delay, providing high performance with simple hardware, translation/optimization overhead, etc. before they can become mainstream. A fundamental
requirement for evaluating different design choices and trade-offs
to meet these challenges is to have a simulation infrastructure.
Unfortunately, there is no such infrastructure available today.
Building the aforementioned infrastructure itself poses significant
challenges as it encompasses the complexities of not only an
architectural framework but also of a compilation one.

This paper identifies the key challenges that HW/SW codesigned processors face and the basic requirements for a simulation infrastructure targeting these architectures. Furthermore,
the paper presents DARCO, a simulation infrastructure to enable
research in this domain.
