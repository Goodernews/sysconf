
NetApp® WAFL is a transactional file system that uses
the copy-on-write mechanism to support fast write performance and efficient snapshot creation. However,
copy-on-write increases the demand on the file system
to find free blocks quickly; failure to do so may impede
allocations for incoming writes. Efficiency is also important, because the task may consume CPU and other
resources. In this paper, we describe the evolution (over
more than a decade) of WAFL’s algorithms and data
structures for reclaiming space with minimal impact on
the overall storage appliance performance.
