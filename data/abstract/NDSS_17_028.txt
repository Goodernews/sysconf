
Oblivious Transfer (OT) is one of the most fundamental cryptographic primitives with wide-spread application in
general secure multi-party computation (MPC) as well as in a
number of tailored and special-purpose problems of interest such
as private set intersection (PSI), private information retrieval
(PIR), contract signing to name a few. Often the instantiations
of OT require prohibitive communication and computation complexity. OT extension protocols are introduced to compute a very
large number of OTs referred as extended OTs at the cost of a
small number of OTs referred as seed OTs.

We present a fast OT extension protocol for small secrets
in active setting. Our protocol when used to produce 1-out-ofn OTs outperforms all the known actively secure OT extensions.
Our protocol is built on the semi-honest secure extension protocol
of Kolesnikov and Kumaresan of CRYPTO’13 (referred as KK13
protocol henceforth) which is the best known OT extension
for short secrets. At the heart of our protocol lies an efficient
consistency checking mechanism that relies on the linearity of
Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codes. Asymptotically, our protocol adds
a communication overhead of O(log «) bits over KK13 protocol
irrespective of the number of extended OTs, where « and yj refer
to computational and statistical security parameter respectively.
Concretely, our protocol when used to generate a large enough
number of OTs adds only 0.011-0.028% communication overhead
and 4-6% runtime overhead both in LAN and WAN over KK13
extension. The runtime overheads drop below 2% when in
addition the number of inputs of the sender in the extended
OTs is large enough.

As an application of our proposed extension protocol, we show
that it can be used to obtain the most efficient PSI protocol secure
against a malicious receiver and a semi-honest sender.
