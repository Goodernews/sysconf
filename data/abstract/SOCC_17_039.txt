systems. However, the implicit sharing underlying most snapshot
implementations makes it difficult to answer basic questions about
the storage costs of individual snapshots. Traditional techniques for
answering these questions incur significant performance penalties
due to expensive metadata overheads. We present a novel probabilistic data structure, compatible with existing storage systems,
that can provide approximate answers about snapshot costs with
very low computational and storage overheads while achieving
better than 95% accuracy for real-world data sets.
