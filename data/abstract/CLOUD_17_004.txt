
In the age of Big Data, advances in distributed technologies and cloud storage services provide highly efficient and
cost-effective solutions to large scale data storage and management. Supporting self-emerging data using clouds is a challenging
problem. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide
a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to
a single point of trust. Supporting attack-resilient timed release of
encrypted data stored in clouds requires new mechanisms for self
emergence of data encryption keys that enables encrypted data
to become accessible at a future point in time. Prior to the release
time, the encryption key remains undiscovered and unavailable in
a secure distributed system, making the private data unavailable.
In this paper, we propose Emerge, a self-emerging timed data
release protocol for securely hiding data encryption keys of
private encrypted data in a large-scale Distributed Hash Table
(DHT) network that makes the data available and accessible only
at the defined release time. We develop a suite of erasure-codingbased routing path construction schemes for securely storing
and routing encryption keys in DHT networks that protect an
adversary from inferring the encryption key prior to the release
time (release-ahead attack) or from destroying the key altogether
(drop attack). Through extensive experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that the proposed schemes are resilient to both
release-ahead attack and drop attack as well as to attacks that
arise due to traditional churn issues in DHT networks.
