
Lambda architecture is a novel event-driven
serverless paradigm that allows companies to build scalable
and reliable enterprise applications. As an attractive alternative
to traditional service oriented architecture (SOA), Lambda
architecture can be used in many use cases including BI
tools, in-memory graph databases, OLAP, and streaming
data processing. In practice, an important aim of Lambdaâ€™s
service providers is devising an efficient way to co-locate
multiple Lambda functions with different attributes into a set
of available computing resources. However, previous studies
showed that consolidated workloads can compete fiercely for
shared resources, resulting in severe performance variability/degradation. This paper proposes a resource allocation
mechanism for a Lambda platform based on the model predictive control framework. Performance evaluation is carried
out by comparing the proposed solution with multiple resource
allocation heuristics, namely enhanced versions of spread and
binpack, and best-effort approaches. Results confirm that the
proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization
by 37% on average and achieves a significant improvement in
preventing QoS violation incidents compared to others.
