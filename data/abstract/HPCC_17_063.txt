
An increasing number of scientific applications
carry out big data transfer through dedicated networks for
global collaboration, where bandwidth scheduling plays a critical
role in improving the utilization of network resources and
meeting diverse user requests. In this paper, we formulate a
periodic bandwidth scheduling problem to maximize the number
of satisfied user requests for profiling-based floating-window
bandwidth reservations under deadline constraint on a network
path, referred to as PFWR-DC. We prove that PFWR-DC is
NP-complete, and propose an integrated bandwidth scheduling
algorithm based on the product of floating-window size and
dynamic transport throughput, referred to as ProductWT-BS.
Extensive simulation results shed light on the performance
superiority of ProductWT-BS in terms of scheduling success ratio
over five heuristic algorithms designed for performance comparison. The proposed scheduling algorithm has great potential to
improve the performance of collaborative scientific applications
that require the floating-window bandwidth provisioning service
for coordinated network-based operations.
