
Scan based error detection architectures for hybrid, carry-free radix-2 and radix-4 addition operations using
redundant arithmetic are presented in this paper. Such addition
operations have been chosen as representative examples as they
are free from carry propagation delay and are ideal from the
viewpoint of technology mapping of the logic elements onto the
FPGA slices. The architectures have been conceived following the
design paradigm of target FPGA specific primitive instantiation
coupled with location constraints, without any degradation in
the speed of circuit operation as compared to the original circuit
implementation without the scan operation. Our architectures
also comfortably outperform the existing state-of-the-art error
detection architectures in terms of speed and consumes less area.
