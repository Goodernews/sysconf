
 In many developing countries, rapid urbanisation
of cities coupled with the lack of proper urban planning has made
various streets susceptible to waterlogging during heavy rains.
This severely affects the traffic movement across an entire city and
leads to disruption in work. Since an important component of
smart cities is developing an efficient urban mobility system, the
authors have developed a method which helps in detection of areas
prone to waterlogging and prediction of severity of waterlogging
in these areas in the future. The areas susceptible to waterlogging
are detected with the help of elevation of the area and the past
travel time data. Elevation of an area is an indicator of the level or
height of an area, so the low-lying areas are more prone to
accumulation of water when it rains. Similarly, the past travel time
data of an area also serves as a measure to find out the intensity of
water logging as the larger the accumulation of water in an area,
the more is the travel time. The past data pertaining to
waterlogging severity in an area with respect to parameters such
as the amount of rainfall and day of the week is used to train a
neural network, which is then used to predict the possibility of
waterlogging and its intensity in that area in the future.
