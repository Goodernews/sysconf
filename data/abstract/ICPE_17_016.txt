remedial actions, thus ensuring rigor in production support
operations of large scale software systems. Performance
anomalies or deterioration, if left unattended, often result
in system slowness and unavailability. In this paper, we
presents a simple, intuitive and low-overhead technique for
recognizing the early warning signs in near real time before they impact the system The technique is based on the
inverse relationship which exists between throughput and
average response time in a closed system. Because of this
relationship, a significant increase in the average system response time causes an abrupt fall in system throughput.
To identify such occurrences automatically, Individuals and
Moving Range (XmR) control charts are used. We also provide a case study from a real-world production system, in
which the technique has been successfully used. The use of
this technique has reduced the occurrence of performance
related incidents significantly in our daily operations. The
technique is tool agnostic and can also be easily implemented
in popular system monitoring tools by building custom extensions.
