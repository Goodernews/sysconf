and partition tolerance over consistency, leading to many systems
that provide weak data consistency. However, weak data consistency is difficult for both system designers and users to reason
about. Formal specifications offer precise descriptions of consistency behavior, but they require expertise and specialized tools
to apply to real software systems. In this paper, we propose and
describe consistency oracles, an alternative way of specifying the
consistency model of a system that provides interactive answers,
making them easier and more flexible to use in a variety of ways.
A consistency oracle mimics the interface of a distributed storage
system, but returns all possible values that may be returned under
a given consistency model. This allows consistency oracles to be
directly applied in the testing and verification of both distributed
storage systems and the client software that uses those systems.
