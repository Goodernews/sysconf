require the deployment of virtual private networks for tenants
in an on-demand manner, providing isolation and security
between tenants. To address these requirements, network
virtualization techniques such as encapsulation and tunneling
have been widely used. However, these approaches inherently
incur processing overhead on end-points (such as the host
hypervisor), reducing the effective throughput for the tenant
virtual network compared to the native network. This problem
is exacerbated with increases in line rates, now exceeding
10Gbps. In this paper, we introduce PARES (PAcket REwriting
on SDN), a novel technique which uses the packet rewriting
feature of SDN switches to provide multi-tenancy in data center
networks at edge switches, thereby reducing the load on endpoint hypervisors and improving the throughput, compared to
tunneling. Experiments in an SDN testbed show that our proposed data center arhictecture with PARES achieves near linerate multi-tenancy virtualization with 10Gbps links (compared
to 20% of line-rate for VXLAN tunneling), without incurring
processing overhead at end-point hypervisors or guest servers.
Additionally, the paper evaluates the scalability of PARES for
ARP protocol handling and with respect to number of SDN
flow entries.
