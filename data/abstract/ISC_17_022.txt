
. Energy consumption is rapidly becoming a limiting factor
in scientific computing. As a result, hardware manufacturers increasingly prioritise energy efficiency in their processor designs. Performance
engineers are also beginning to explore software optimisation and hardware/software co-design as a means to reduce energy consumption.
Energy efficiency metrics developed by the hardware community are
often re-purposed to guide these software optimisation efforts.

In this paper we argue that established metrics, and in particular those
in the Energy Delay Product (£t”) family, are unsuitable for energyaware software optimisation. A good metric should provide meaningful
values for a single experiment, allow fair comparison between experiments, and drive optimisation in a sensible direction. We show that Et”
metrics are unable to fulfil these basic requirements and present suitable
alternatives for guiding energy-aware software optimisation. We finish
with a practical demonstration of the utility of our proposed metrics.
