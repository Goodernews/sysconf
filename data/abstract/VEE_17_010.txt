
Cloud computing has become indispensable in today’s computer landscape. The flexibility it offers for customers as
well as for providers has become a crucial factor for large
parts of the computer industry. Virtualization is the key technology that allows for sharing of hardware resources among
different customers. The controlling software component,
called hypervisor, provides a virtualized view of the computer resources and ensures separation of different guest virtual machines. However, this important cornerstone of cloud
computing is not necessarily trustworthy or bug-free. To mitigate this threat AMD introduced Secure Encrypted Virtualization, short SEV, which transparently encrypts a virtual
machines memory.

In this paper we analyse to what extend the proposed features can resist a malicious hypervisor and discuss the tradeoffs imposed by additional protection mechanisms. To do so,
we developed a model of SEV’s security capabilities based
on the available documentation as actual silicon implementations are not yet on the market.

We found that the first proposed version of SEV is not
up to the task owing to three design shortcomings. First the
virtual machine control block is not encrypted and handled
directly by the hypervisor, allowing it to bypass VM memory
encryption by executing conveniently chosen gadgets. Secondly, the general purpose registers are not encrypted upon
vmexit, leaking potentially sensitive data. Finally, the control
over the nested pagetables allows a malicious hypervisor to
closely monitor the execution state of a VM and attack it
with memory replay attacks.
