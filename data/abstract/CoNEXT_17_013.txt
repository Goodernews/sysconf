
Location information is crucial for enabling many applications in
the era of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Localizing IoT devices using
existing ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure enables rapid and universal
deployment of IoT devices empowered with localization service.
However, current WiFi-based localization systems require the target, that needs to be localized, to be equipped with a WiFi radio
that actively transmits WiFi signals. Since a WiFi radio consumes

energy-impoverish IoT devices (for example, locating a pill bottlemyinpill?

floor plan
that reuses existing WiFi infrastructures
for localizing low-power
backscatter tags. We build upon recent work on low power tags
that communicate via backscattering ambient WiFi signals and
introduce novel modeling of the backscattered signal received at
WiFi access points to localize the target IoT device. We prototype
WiTag using off-the-shelf WiFi chips and a customized backscatter
tag and show that it achieves sub-meter localization error. Thus,
WiTag achieves localization error comparable to that of state-ofthe-art WiFi based localization systems while consuming orders of
magnitude lower power at the target IoT devices.
