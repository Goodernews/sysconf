records, and analyzes the behavior of an application and
its impact on the system as a directed acyclic provenance
graph. It assumes that most instances behave normally
and uses their behavior to construct a model of legitimate
behavior. Given a model of legitimate behavior, FRAP
uses a dynamic sliding window algorithm to compare a
new instanceâ€™s execution to that of the model. Any instance that does not conform to the model is identified
as an anomaly. We present the FRAP prototype and experimental results showing that it can accurately detect
application anomalies.
