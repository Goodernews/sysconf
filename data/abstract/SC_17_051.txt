
The byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) is new promising storage medium. Compared to NAND flash memory, the nextgeneration NVM not only preserves the durability of stored data
but has much shorter access latencies. An architect can utilize the
fast and persistent NVM as an external disk cache. Regarding the
systemâ€™s crash consistency, a prevalent journaling file system needs
to run atop an NVM disk cache. However, the performance is severely impaired by redundant efforts in achieving crash consistency
in both file system and disk cache. Therefore, we propose a new
mechanism called transactional NVM disk cache (Tinca). In brief,
Tinca jointly guarantees consistency of file system and disk cache
and removes the performance penalty of file system journaling with
a lightweight transaction scheme. Evaluations confirm that Tinca
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art design by up to 2.5x in
local and cluster tests without causing any inconsistency issue.
