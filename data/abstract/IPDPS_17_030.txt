
Increasingly complex memory systems and onchip interconnects are developed to mitigate the data movement
bottlenecks in manycore processors. One example of such a
complex system is the Xeon Phi KNL CPU with three different
types of memory, fifteen memory configuration options, and
a complex on-chip mesh network connecting up to 72 cores.
Users require a detailed understanding of the performance
characteristics of the different options to utilize the system efficiently. Unfortunately, peak performance is rarely achievable
and achievable performance is hardly documented. We address
this with capability models of the memory subsystem, derived
by systematic measurements, to guide users to navigate the
complex optimization space. As a case study, we provide an
extensive model of all memory configuration options for Xeon
Phi KNL. We demonstrate how our capability model can be
used to automatically derive new close-to-optimal algorithms
for various communication functions yielding improvements 5x
and 24x over Intelâ€™s tuned OpenMP and MPI implementations,
respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the
models to assess how efficiently a bitonic sort application
utilizes the memory resources. Interestingly, our capability
models predict and explain that the high bandwidth MCDRAM
does not improve the bitonic sort performance over DRAM.
