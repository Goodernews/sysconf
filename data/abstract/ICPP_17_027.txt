counts to meet stringent performance requirements. Both
the NetApp® Data ONTAP® storage operating system and
its WAFL” file system have been incrementally parallelized over the years, but some components remain singlethreaded. The WAFL write allocator, which is responsible
for assigning blocks on persistent storage to dirty data in a
way that maximizes write throughput to the storage media,
is single-threaded and has become a major scalability
bottleneck. This paper presents a new write allocation
architecture, White Alligator, for the WAFL file system that
scales performance on many cores. We also place the new
architecture in the context of the historical parallelization
of WAFL and discuss the architectural decisions that have
facilitated this parallelism. The resulting system demonstrates increased scalability that results in throughput
gains of up to 274% on a many-core storage system.
