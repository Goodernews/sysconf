automatic synthesis of a textual artifact from models. This is
a very useful model transformation to generate application
code, to serialize the model in persistent storage, generate
documentation or reports. Among the various model-totext (M2T) paradigms, template-based code generation is the
most popular in MDE. This is supported by over 70 different
tools, whether they are model-based (e.g., Acceleo, EGL) or
code-based (JET, Velocity). To help developers in their difficult choice of selecting the M2T tool, we compare the expressiveness power and performance of the nine most popular
tools spanning the different technological approaches. We
evaluate the expressiveness based on common metamodel
patterns and evaluate the performance on a range of models
that conform to a metamodel composed by the combination
of these patterns. The results show that MDE-based tools
are more expressive, but that code-based tools are more performant. Xtend2 offers the best compromise between the
expressiveness and the performance.
