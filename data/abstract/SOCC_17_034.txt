calls to revisit traditional operation and provisioning processes.
Providers are realizing services in software on virtual machines
instead of using dedicated appliances to dynamically adjust service
capacity to changing demands. Cloud orchestration systems control the number of service instances deployed to make sure each
service has enough capacity to meet incoming workloads. However,
determining the suitable build-out of a service is challenging as it
takes time to install new instances and excessive re-configurations
(i.e. scale in/out) can lead to decreased stability. In this paper we
present AidOps, a cloud orchestration system that leverages machine learning and domain-specific knowledge to predict the traffic
demand, optimizing service performance and cost. AidOps does
not require a conservative provisioning of services to cover for
the worst-case demand and significantly reduces operational costs
while still fulfilling service quality expectations. We have evaluated
our framework with real traffic using an enterprise application and
a communication service in a private cloud. Our results show up
to 4X improvement in service performance indicators compared
to existing orchestration systems. AidOps achieves up to 99.985%
availability levels while reducing operational costs at least by 20%.
