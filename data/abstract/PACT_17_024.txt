decades because of its superior performance and power efficiency. The configurations of SIMD registers (i.e., the number
and width) have evolved and diverged rapidly through various
ISA extensions on different architectures. However, migrating
legacy or proprietary applications optimized for one guest ISA
to another host ISA that has fewer but longer SIMD registers through binary translation raises the issues of asymmetric
SIMD register configurations. To date, these issues have been
overlooked. As a result, only a small fraction of the potential
performance gain is realized due to underutilization of the
host’s SIMD parallelism and register capacity.

In this paper, we present a novel dynamic binary translation technique called spill-aware SLP (saSLP), which combines
short ARMv8 NEON instructions and registers in the guest
binary loops to fully utilize the x86 AVX host’s parallelism as
well as minimize register spilling. Our experiment results show
that saSLP improves the performance by 1.6X (2.3X) across
a number of benchmarks, and reduces spilling by 97% (99%)
for ARMv8 NEON to x86 AVX2 (AVX-512) translation.
