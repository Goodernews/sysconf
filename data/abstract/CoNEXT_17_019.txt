by improving their networking performance. State-of-the-art CoFlow
schedulers in essence approximate the classic online Shortest-JobFirst (SJF) scheduling, designed for a single CPU, in a distributed
setting, with no coordination among how the flows of a CoFlow at
individual ports are scheduled, and as a result suffer two performance
drawbacks: (1) The flows of a CoFlow may suffer the out-of-sync
problem â€” they may be scheduled at different times and become
drifting apart, negatively affecting the CoFlow completion time
(CCT); (2) FIFO scheduling of flows at each port bears no notion of
SJF, leading to suboptimal CCT.

We propose SAATH, an online CoFlow scheduler that overcomes
the above drawbacks by explicitly exploiting the spatial dimension
of CoFlows. In SAATH, the global scheduler schedules the flows of a
CoFlow using an all-or-none policy which mitigates the out-of-sync
problem. To order the CoFlows within each queue, SAATH resorts to
a Least-Contention-First (LCoF) policy which we show extends the
gist of SJF to the spatial dimension, complemented with starvation
freedom. Our evaluation using an Azure testbed and simulations of
two production cluster traces show that compared to Aalo, SAATH
reduces the CCT in median (P90) cases by 1.53x (4.5x) and 1.42x
(7x), respectively.
