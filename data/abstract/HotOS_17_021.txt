that appear in “cloud-scale” distributed systems. Scalability bugs
are latent bugs that are cluster-scale dependent, whose symptoms
typically surface in large-scale deployments, but not in small or
medium-scale deployments. The standard practice to test large distributed systems is to deploy them on a large number of machines
(“real-scale testing”), which is difficult and expensive. New methods are needed to reduce developers’ burdens in finding, reproducing, and debugging scalability bugs. We propose “scale check,” an
approach that helps developers find and replay scalability bugs at
real scales, but do so only on one machine and still achieve a high
accuracy (i.e., similar observed behaviors as if the nodes are deployed in real-scale testing).
