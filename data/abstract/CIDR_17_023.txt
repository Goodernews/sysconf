
It is expensive to maintain strong data consistency during concurrent execution. However, weak consistency levels, which are considered harmful, have been widely applied
in analytical jobs. Their success challenges our belief: data
consistency, which is believed to be an essential to precise
computing, does not always need to be preserved. In this
paper, we tackle one of the core questions related to the application of weak consistency: When does weak consistency
work well? We propose an effective explanation for the success of weak consistency. We name it bad things do not come
in threes, or BN3. It is based on the observation that the
volume of data is far larger than the number of workers. If all
workers are operating concurrently, the probability that two
workers access the same data at the same time is relatively
low. Although it is not small enough to be neglected, the
chance that three or more workers access the same data at
the same time is even lower. Based on the BN3 conjecture,
we analyze different consistency levels. We show that a weak
consistency level in transaction processing is equivalent to
snapshot isolation (SI) under reasonable assumptions. Although the BN3 is an oversimplification of real scenarios,
it explains why weak consistency often achieves results that
are accurate enough. It also serves as a quality promise for
the future wide application of weak consistency in analytical
tasks. We verify our results in experimental studies.
