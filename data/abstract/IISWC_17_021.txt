
he VMware ESXi hypervisor attracts a wide range
of customers and is deployed in domains ranging from desktop
computing to server computing. While the software systems
are increasingly moving towards consolidation, hardware has
already transitioned into multi-socket Non-Uniform Memory
Access (NUMA)-based systems. The marriage of increasing
consolidation and the multi-socket based systems warrants lowoverhead, simple and practical mechanisms to detect and address
performance bottlenecks, without causing additional contention
for shared resources such as performance counters. In this paper,
we propose a simple, practical and highly accurate, dynamic
memory latency probing mechanism to detect memory congestion
in a NUMA system. Using these dynamic probed latencies, we
propose congestion-aware memory allocation, congestion-aware
memory migration, and a combination of these two techniques.
These proposals, evaluated on Intel Westmere (8 nodes) and Intel
Haswell (2 nodes) using various workloads, improve the overall
performance on an average by 7.2% and 9.5% respectively.
