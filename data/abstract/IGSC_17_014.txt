
In this paper, we present an enhanced and holistic
energy model for the widely used Network Simulator, NS3. As
computing becomes more energy efficient, data movement, and
hence data center networks consume an increasing percentage
of the total energy consumption and it is important to provide
energy management capabilities in the network simulators. Our
enhanced NS3 simulator supports the use of different sleep
modes for each network port on a switch/router and endpoint, and backplane on switch/router in order to reduce the
network energy consumption. It also supports two port level
power management mechanisms - unidirectional (transmitter
only) and bidirectional (transmitter and receiver). Moreover, the
simulator supports local consolidation that consolidates traffic
across multiple outgoing/incoming links into a node, and a global
controller that monitors all links in the network via a SDN-like
mechanism and helps make better local consolidation decisions.
The implemented capabilities are illustrated by applying them
to the popular fat-tree based data center network. It is shown
that the local consolidation mechanism coupled with bidirection
port-level energy management can reduce the network energy
consumption substantially.
