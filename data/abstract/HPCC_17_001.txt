
With the increase of scale and complexity seen in a
variety of leadership-class scientific computation and simulation
applications, it has become more important to understand their
I/O performance characteristics. The user-observed performance
is a combination of properties of how the application is using
the HPC facility, as well as how othersâ€™ use of the facility causes
variability in the static machine capabilities. Our work leverages
statistical analysis of I/O performance data gathered with fine
time resolution over a full week from Titan supercomputer. Based
on observed properties of the distribution of I/O latencies, we
build a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize
the end-to-end I/O performance on Titan. We parameterize our
model using part of the field-gathered I/O performance data and
validate it against the rest. The validation results demonstrate
that our model can capture the dynamics of end-to-end I/O
performance on Titan accurately.
