
Virtualization helps to deploy the functionality of
expensive and rigid hardware appliances on scalable virtual
resources running on commodity servers. However, optimal
resource provisioning for non-trivial services is still an open
problem. While there have been efforts to answer the questions of
when to provision additional resources in a running service, and
how many resources are needed, the question of what should be
provisioned has not been investigated, in particular, for complex
applications or services, which consist of a set of connected
components, where each component in turn potentially consists of
multiple component instances (e.g., VMs or containers). Each instance of a component can be run in different flavors (i.e., number
of cores or amount of memory), while the service constructed by
the combination of these component configurations must satisfy
the customer Service Level Objective (SLO). In this work, we
offer to service providers an answer to the what to deploy
question by introducing RConf, a system that automatically
chooses the optimal combination of component instances for nontrivial network services. In particular, we propose an analytical
model based on robust queuing theory that is able to accurately
model arbitrary components, and develop an algorithm that
finds the combination of their instances, such that the overall
utilization of the running instances is maximized while meeting
SLO requirements.
