acknowledged to be overestimated and runtime overestimation
can greatly degrade job scheduling performance. Previous studies
focus on improving accuracy of job runtime estimates by reducing
runtime overestimation, but fail to address the underestimation
problem (i.e., the underestimation of job runtimes). Using an
underestimated runtime is catastrophic to a job as the job will
be killed by the scheduler before completion. We argue that
both the improvement of runtime accuracy and the reduction
of underestimation rate are equally important. To address this
problem, we propose an online runtime adjustment framework
called TRIP. TRIP explores the data censoring capability of the
Tobit model to improve prediction accuracy while keeping a low
underestimation rate of job runtimes. TRIP can be used as a
plugin to job scheduler for improving job runtime estimates and
hence boosting job scheduling performance. Preliminary results
demonstrate that TRIP is capable of achieving high accuracy of
80% and low underestimation rate of 5%. This is significant
as compared to other well-known machine learning methods
such as SVM, Random Forest, and Last-2 which result in a
high underestimation rate (20%-50%). Our experiments further
quantify the amount of scheduling performance gain achieved by
the use of TRIP.
