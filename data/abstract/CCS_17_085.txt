efficient, expressive, and information-theoretically private singleround queries over multi-server PIR databases. Our approach decouples the way that users construct their requests for data from
the physical layout of the remote data store, thereby enabling users
to fetch data using “contextual” queries that specify which data
they seek, as opposed to “positional” queries that specify where
those data happen to reside. For example, an open-access eprint
repository could employ indexes of queries to let researchers fetch
academic articles via PIR queries such as for “this year’s 5 most
cited papers about PIR” or “the 3 most recently posted papers about
PIR”. Our basic approach is compatible with any PIR protocol in
the ubiquitous “vector-matrix” model for PIR, though the most
sophisticated and useful of our constructions rely on some nice
algebraic properties of Goldberg’s IT-PIR protocol (Oakland 2007).
We have implemented our techniques as an extension to Percy++,
an open-source implementation of Goldberg’s IT-PIR protocol. Our
experiments indicate that the new techniques can greatly improve
not only utility for private information retrievers but also efficiency
for private information retrievers and servers alike.
