
Factorizing large matrices by QR with column
pivoting (QRCP) is substantially more expensive than QR
without pivoting, owing to communication costs required for
pivoting decisions. In contrast, randomized QRCP (RQRCP)
algorithms have proven themselves empirically to be highly

xGEQPF and PxGEQPF respectively. They are considerably
faster, while maintaining same numerical behavior.

Given a target rank 1 < k < min (m, n) in partial QRCP,
equation (1) can be written in a 2 x 2 block form as

competitive with high-performance implementations of QR in R R R R
processing time, on uniprocessor and shared memory machines, AT=Q ( 6. z,. ) _ ( Qi Qe ) ( o z, ) ;
and as reliable as QRCP in pivot quality. 22 22

We show that RQRCP algorithms can be as reliable as
QRCP with failure probabilities exponentially decaying in
oversampling size. We also analyze efficiency differences among
different RQRCP algorithms. More importantly, we develop
distributed memory implementations of RQRCP that are significantly better than QRCP implementations in ScaLAPACK.

As a further development, we introduce the concept of
and develop algorithms for computing spectrum-revealing QR
factorizations for low-rank matrix approximations, and demonstrate their effectiveness against leading low-rank approximation methods in both theoretical and numerical reliability and
efficiency.
