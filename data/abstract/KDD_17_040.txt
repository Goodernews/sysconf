topics with many applications. In practical problems, features often
have group structure to effect the outcomes. Thus, it is crucial to
automatically identify homogenous groups of features for highdimensional data analysis. Octagonal shrinkage and clustering
algorithm for regression (OSCAR) is an important sparse regression approach with automatic feature grouping and selection by
€; norm and pairwise fo. norm. However, due to over-complex
representation of the penalty (especially the pairwise fo. norm),
so far OSCAR has no solution path algorithm which is mostly useful for tuning the model. To address this challenge, in this paper,
we propose a groups-keeping solution path algorithm to solve the
OSCAR model (OscarGKPath). Given a set of homogenous groups
of features and an accuracy bound ¢, OscarGKPath can fit the solutions in an interval of regularization parameters while keeping
the feature groups. The entire solution path can be obtained by
combining multiple such intervals. We prove that all solutions in
the solution path produced by OscarGKPath can strictly satisfy the
given accuracy bound ¢. The experimental results on benchmark
datasets not only confirm the effectiveness of our OscarGKPath
algorithm, but also show the superiority of our OscarGKPath in
cross validation compared with the existing batch algorithm.
