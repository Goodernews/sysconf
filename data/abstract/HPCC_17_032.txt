significant part in intelligent traffic system. At present, there are
many traditional approaches that have achieved a rather high
accuracy to solve this problem, almost all of which are separated
into three steps of localization, segmentation and recognition.
However, these approaches, especially in segmentation progress,
are limited to some specific conditions including light intensity,
orientations, rotation and distortion angle of plates, etc. In this
paper, distinct from traditional approaches, a network including a
convolutional neural network(CNN) that operates directly on the
image pixels is employed as a substitute of the integration of
segmentation and recognition. The network works on the
TensorFlow framework. Evaluation of this training network is
charactersâ€™ recognition accuracy on a test set of 796 number plate
pictures. In result, we achieve a 88.61% accuracy with a training
set of only 7396 photographs that are expanded from 3041 different
number plate pictures, which is a relatively high accuracy,
especially for a deep CNN that usually needs a great number of
samples. We also demonstrate one possible way to enrich data set
and make a test using a even simpler network, which results in a
90.07% accuracy on a test set.
