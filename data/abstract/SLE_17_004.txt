
Modern enterprises operate in an unprecedented
regulatory environment where increasing regulation and
heavy penalties on non-compliance have placed
regulatory compliance among the topmost concerns of
enterprises worldwide. Previous research in the field of
compliance has established that the manual specification
of the regulations used by GRC frameworks not only fails
to ensure their proper coverage but also negatively
affects the turnaround time both in proving and
maintaining the compliance. Our key contribution in this
paper is an implementation of a controlled natural
English like (domain-specific) language that can be used
by domain experts to specify regulations for automated
compliance checking. We demonstrate this language
using examples from industry regulations in financial
services domain.
