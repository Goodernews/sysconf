
Motivated by the asymmetric read and write costs of emerging
non-volatile memory technologies, we study lower bounds for
the problems of sorting, permuting and multiplying a sparse ma-
trix by a dense vector in the asymmetric external memory model
(AEM). Given an AEM with internal (symmetric) memory of size M,
transfers between symmetric and asymmetric memory in blocks of
size B and the ratio ω between write and read costs, we show ωN N
Ω(min{N, B logωM B }) lower bound for the cost of permut- B
ing N input elements. This lower bound also applies to the problem
of sorting N elements. This proves that the existing sorting algo-
rithms in the AEM model are optimal to within a constant factor
for reasonable ranges of parameters N , M, B, and ω. We also show a lower bound of Ω min H, B logωM max{δ,M} for the cost B
of multiplying an N × N matrix with at most H = δ N non-empty entries by a vector with N elements.
