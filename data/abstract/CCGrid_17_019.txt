
Graph Processing has been widely used to capture
complex data dependency and uncover relationship insights.
Due to the ever-growing graph scale and algorithm complexity,
distributed graph processing has become more and more popular.
In this paper, we investigate how to balance performance and cost
for large scale graph processing on configurable virtual machines
(VMs). We analyze the system architecture and implementation
details of a Pregel-like distributed graph processing framework
and develop a system-aware model to predict the execution
time. Consequently, cost effective execution scenarios are recommended by selecting a certain number of VMs with specified
capability subject to the predefined resource price and user
preference. Experiments using synthetic and real world graphs
have verified that system-aware model can achieve much higher
prediction accuracy than popular machine-learning models which
treat graph processing framework as a black box. As a result,
the recommended execution scenarios have comparable cost
efficiency to the optimal scenarios.
