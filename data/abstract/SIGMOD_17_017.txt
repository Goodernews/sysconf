networks of sensor devices using relational and signal processing
operations and running the same query logic over groups of sensor
signals. To support such increasingly important scenarios, many
data management systems integrate with numerical frameworks like
R. Such solutions, however, incur significant performance penalties as relational data processing engines and numerical tools operate on fundamentally different data models with expensive intercommunication mechanisms. In addition, none of these solutions
supports efficient real-time and incremental analysis.

In this paper, we advocate a deep integration of signal processing
operations and general-purpose query processors. We aim to reconcile the disparate data models and provide a common query language that allows users to seamlessly interleave tempo-relational
and signal operations for both online and offline processing. Our
approach is extensible and offers frameworks for quick and easy
integration of user-defined operations while supporting incremental computation. Our system that deeply integrates relational and
signal operations, called TRILLDSP, achieves up to two orders of
magnitude better performance than popular loosely-coupled data
management systems on grouped signal processing workflows.
