
As VMware are now widely used in desktop and server environ
Mobile apps make extensive use of GPUs on smartphones and
tablets to access Web content. To support pervasive Web content,
we introduce three key OS techniques for binary graphics compatibility necessary to build a real-world system to run iOS and
Android apps together on the same smartphone or tablet. First diplomat usage patterns manage resources to bridge proprietary iOS
and Android graphics implementations. Second, thread impersonation allows a single thread-specific context to be shared amongst
multiple threads using multiple iOS and Android personas. Third,
dynamic library replication allows multiple, independent instances
of the same library to be loaded in a single process to support iOS
apps on Android while using multiple graphics API versions at
the same time. We use these techniques to build a system prototype, and demonstrate that it runs widely-used iOS apps, including
apps such as Safari that use the popular GPU-accelerated WebKit
framework, using a Google Nexus tablet running Android.
