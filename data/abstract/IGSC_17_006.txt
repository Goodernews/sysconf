
 â€” As big data emerges, the complexity of database
workloads and database systems has increased significantly. It
is no longer possible for one type of database to efficiently
handle all big data applications. NoSQL databases are widely
used to complement conventional SQL databases. In addition to
traditional metrics such as response time and throughput, large
scale NoSQL database systems pose higher requirements on
energy efficiency due to the incredible volume of data (and the
associated cost) that need to be stored and processed.
Unfortunately, research on optimizations for energy efficiency
in database systems has been historically overlooked. In this
paper, we investigate numerous optimizations for two NoSQL
databases (MongoDB and Cassandra) and conduct a
comprehensive study on the impact of these optimizations on
performance and energy efficiency. Our experimental results
derived from 100GB of Twitter data reveal that 1) energy
efficiency can be improved significantly for both MongoDB and
Cassandra via query optimizations without degrading
performance; and 2) energy efficiency does not always scale
linearly with performance improvement.
