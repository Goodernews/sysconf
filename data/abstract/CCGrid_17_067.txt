
A challenging problem for users of Infrastructureas-a-Service (IaaS) clouds is selecting cloud providers, regions,
and instance types cost-optimally for a given desired service
level. Issues such as hardware heterogeneity, contention, and
virtual machine (VM) placement can result in considerably
differing performance across supposedly equivalent cloud resources. Existing research on cloud benchmarking helps, but
often the focus is on providing low-level microbenchmarks (e.g.,
CPU or network speed), which are hard to map to concrete
business metrics of enterprise cloud applications, such as request
throughput of a multi-tier Web application. In this paper, we
propose OKta, a general approach for fairly and comprehensively
benchmarking the performance and cost of a multi-tier Web
application hosted in an IaaS cloud. We exemplify our approach
for a case study based on the two-tier AcmeAir application,
which we evaluate for 11 real-life deployment configurations on
Amazon EC2 and Google Compute Engine. Our results show
that for this application, choosing compute-optimized instance
types in the Web layer and small bursting instances for the
database tier leads to the overall most cost-effective deployments.
This result held true for both cloud providers. The least costeffective configuration in our study provides only about 67%
of throughput per US dollar spent. Our case study can serve
as a blueprint for future industrial or academic application
benchmarking projects.
