
As the memory and storage hierarchy get deeper
and more complex, it is important to have new benchmarks and
evaluation tools that allow us to explore the emerging middleware
solutions to use this hierarchy. Skel is a tool aimed at automating
and refining this process of studying HPC I/O performance.
It works by generating application I/O kernel/benchmarks as
determined by a domain-specific model. This paper provides
some techniques for extending Skel to address new situations and
to answer new research questions. For example, we document use
cases as diverse as using Skel to troubleshoot I/O performance
issues for remote users, refining an I/O system model, and facilitating the development and testing of a mechanism for runtime
monitoring and performance analytics. We also discuss dataoriented extensions to Skel to support the study of compression
techniques for Exascale scientific data management.
