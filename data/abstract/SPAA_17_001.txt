of any constraint satisfaction problem can be computed in NC;
that is, in parallel polylogarithmic time and polynomial work. As
a complexity-theoretic consequence we get that MIP1[k,c,s] ¢
PSPACE provided s/c < (.62 — o(1))k/2, resolving a question
of Austrin, Hastad, and Pass. Here MIP 1[k,c, s] is the class of languages decidable with completeness c and soundness s by an interactive proof system with k provers, each constrained to communicate
just 1 bit.
