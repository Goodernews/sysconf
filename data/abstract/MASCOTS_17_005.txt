big data analytics due to the flexibility, scalability, and costeffectiveness of provisioning elastic resources on-demand. However, data analytics-as-a-service suffers from the overheads of
data movement between compute and storage clusters, due to
their decoupled architecture in existing cloud infrastructure. In
this work, we propose a novel approach of in-situ big data
processing on cloud storage by dynamically offloading dataintensive jobs from compute cluster to storage cluster, and
improve job throughput. However, it is challenging to achieve this
goal since introducing additional workload on the storage cluster
can significantly impact interactive web requests that fetch cloud
storage data, with strict SLA (service-level agreement) for tail
latency. In this work, we present MPLEX, a system that augments
data analytics-as-a-service by efficiently multiplexing compute
and storage cluster to improve job throughput without violating
the SLA of cloud storage service in terms of tail response time.
It applies an SLA-aware opportunistic job scheduling technique
supported by a machine learning based prediction model to
exploit the dynamic workload conditions in the compute, and
storage cluster. Performance evaluations on an OpenStack Swift
cluster, and an OpenStack based virtual cluster of Hadoop VMs
built atop NSFCloudâ€™s Chameleon testbed show that MPLEX
improves the Hadoop job throughput by up to 1.7X, while
maintaining the SLA for cloud storage service requests.
