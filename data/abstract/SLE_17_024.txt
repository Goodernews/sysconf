
Selecting and properly using approaches for DSL implementation can be challenging, given their variety and complexity.
To support developers, we present the software chrestomathy
MetaLib, a well-organized and well-documented collection
of DSL implementations useful for learning. We focus on
basic metaprogramming techniques for implementing DSL
syntax and semantics. The DSL implementations are organized and enhanced by feature modeling, semantic annotation, and model-based documentation. The chrestomathy
enables side-by-side exploration of different implementation
approaches for DSLs. Source code, feature model, feature
configurations, semantic annotations, and documentation
are publicly available online, explorable through a web application, and maintained by a collaborative process
