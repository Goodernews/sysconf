
Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) in chip multiprocessors
are prone to within-die process variation as they span the
whole chip. To tolerate variation, their voltages (Via) carry
over-provisioned guardbands. As a result, prior work has
proposed to save energy by operating at reduced Via while
occasionally suffering and fixing errors. Unfortunately, these
proposals use heuristic controller designs that provide no error
bounds guarantees.

In this work, we develop a scheme that dynamically minimizes the Vaq of groups of routers in a variation-prone NoC
using formal control-theoretic methods. The scheme, called
Sthira, saves substantial energy while guaranteeing the stability
and convergence of error rates. We also enhance the scheme
with a low-cost secondary network that retransmits erroneous
packets for higher energy efficiency. The enhanced scheme is
called Sthira+. We evaluate Sthira and Sthira+ with simulations
of NoCs with 64-100 routers. In an NoC with 8 routers per Via
domain, our schemes reduce the average energy consumption
of the NoC by 27%; in a futuristic NoC with one router per
Vaa domain, Sthira+ and Sthira reduce the average energy
consumption by 36% and 32%, respectively. The performance
impact is negligible. These are significant savings over the stateof-the-art. We conclude that formal control is essential, and that
the cheaper Sthira is more cost-effective than Sthira+.
