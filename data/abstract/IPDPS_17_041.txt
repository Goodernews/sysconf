
Emerging applications for data analytics and knowledge discovery typically have irregular or unpredictable communication patterns that do not scale well on parallel systems
designed for traditional bulk-synchronous HPC applications. New
network architectures that focus on minimizing (short) message
latencies, rather than maximizing (large) transfer bandwidths,
are emerging as possible alternatives to better support those
applications with irregular communication patterns. We explore
a system based upon one such novel network architecture,
the Data Vortex interconnection network, and examine how
this system performs by running benchmark code written for
the Data Vortex network, as well as a reference MPI-overInfiniband implementation, on the same cluster. Simple communication primitives (ping-pong and barrier synchronization), a
few common communication kernels (distributed 1D Fast Fourier
Transform, breadth-first search, Giga-Updates Per Second) and
three prototype applications (a proxy application for simulating
neutron transport-’SNAP”, a finite difference simulation for
computing incompressible fluid flow, and an implementation of
the heat equation) were all implemented for both network models.
The results were compared and analyzed to determine what
characteristics make an application a good candidate for porting
to a Data Vortex system, and to what extent applications could
potentially benefit from this new architecture.
