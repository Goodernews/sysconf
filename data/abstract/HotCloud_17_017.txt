content closer to users and thus improve page load times.
While this model’s success is beyond question, it has its
limits: for users with poor last-mile latency even to a
nearby CDN node, the many RTTs needed to fetch a Web
page add up to large delays. Thus, in this work, we explore a complementary model of speeding up Web page
delivery — a content gathering network (CGN), whereby
users establish their own geo-distributed presence, and
use these points of presence to proxy content for them.
We show that deploying only 14 public cloud-based CGN
nodes puts the closest node within a median RTT of
merely 4.8 ms (7.2 ms) from servers hosting the top 10k
(100k) most popular Web sites. The CGN node nearest
to a server can thus obtain content from it rapidly, and
then transmit it to the client over fewer (limited by available bandwidth) high-latency interactions using aggressive transport protocols. This simple approach reduces
the median page load time across 100 popular Web sites
by as much as 53%, and can be deployed immediately
without depending on any changes to Web servers at an
estimated cost of under $1 per month per user.
