
In most Big Data applications, the data is heterogeneous.
As we have been arguing in a series of papers, storage engines should be well suited to the data they hold. Therefore,
a system supporting Big Data applications should be able to
expose multiple storage engines through a single interface.
We call such systems, polystore systems. Our reference implementation of the polystore concept is called BigDAWG
(short for the Big Data Analytics Working Group). In this
demonstration, we will show the BigDAWG system and a
number of polystore applications built to help ocean metagenomics researchers handle their heterogenous Big Data.
