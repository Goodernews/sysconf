logger to store information (i.e., the determinants) to allow the recovery
of an application process. This centralized approach, besides suffering
from the single point of failure problem, represents a bottleneck for the
efficiency of message logging protocols. In this work, we present a faulttolerant distributed event logger based on consensus that outperforms
the centralized approach. We implemented the event logger of MPI determinants using the Paxos algorithm. Our event logger inherits the Paxos
properties: safety is guaranteed even if the system is asynchronous and
liveness is guaranteed despite processes failures. Experimental results are
reported for the performance of the distributed event logger based both
on classic Paxos and parallel Paxos applied to AMG (Algebraic MultiGrid) and NAS Parallel Benchmark applications.
