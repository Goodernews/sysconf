and, more generally, bounded treewidth conjunctive queries
(CQs). We show that OMQs with bounded depth ontologies
have nonrecursive datalog (NDL) rewritings that can be constructed and evaluated in LOGCFL for combined complexity,
and even in NL if their CQs are tree-shaped with a bounded
number of leaves. Thus, such OMQs incur no overhead in
complexity-theoretic terms. For OMQs with arbitrary ontologies and bounded-leaf tree-shaped CQs, NDL-rewritings
are constructed and evaluated in LOGCFL. We experimentally demonstrate feasibility and scalability of our rewritings
compared to previously proposed NDL-rewritings. On the
negative side, we prove that answering OMQs with treeshaped CQs is not fixed-parameter tractable if the ontology
depth or the number of leaves in the CQs is regarded as the
parameter, and that answering OMQs with a fixed ontology
(of infinite depth) is NP-complete for tree-shaped CQs and
LOGCFL-complete for bounded-leaf CQs.
