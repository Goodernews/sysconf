
Designing 3D systems with on-chip DRAM is a
promising solution to improve memory bandwidth and reduce
memory access latency. However, 3D chips exacerbate the chip
thermal problem due to their longer heat dissipation path, as well
as the tight thermal coupling between logic and memory layers. In
this paper, we are interested in studying thermal aware resource
management strategies for both CPUs and memory systems when
realizing hard real-time systems on 3D platforms under given peak
temperature constraints. Given the dramatically increased power
density not only from CPUs but also from memory systems as well,
we believe that a joint CPU and memory system resource management is highly desired for 3D platforms to effectively deal with the
heat dissipation confined in a small package. In addition, different
from many existing thermal management strategies, which are
reactive and best-effort in nature, we are more interested in ones
that can ensure the strong guarantee for real-time applications.
To this end, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates the
periodic resource model to guarantee timing constraints for hard
real-time systems under thermal constraints. In the meantime,
by periodically (deterministically) throttling the accesses of CPUs
and memory resources, our approach can effectively guarantee
the thermal constraints imposed on both CPUs and memory
systems. We use simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed approach in guaranteeing both the timing and
temperature constraints for hard real-time tasks on 3D platforms.
