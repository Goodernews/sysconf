
We present an in-depth analysis of transient faults effects on HPC
applications in Intel Xeon Phi processors based on radiation experiments and high-level fault injection. Besides measuring the realistic
error rates of Xeon Phi, we quantify Silent Data Corruption (SDCs)
by correlating the distribution of corrupted elements in the output to the application’s characteristics. We evaluate the benefits
of imprecise computing for reducing the programs’ error rate. For
example, for HotSpot a 0.5% tolerance in the output value reduces
the error rate by 85%.

We inject different fault models to analyze the sensitivity of
given applications. We show that portions of applications can be
graded by different criticalities. For example, faults occurring in
the middle of LUD execution, or in the Sort and Tree portions of
CLAMR, are more critical than the remaining portions. Mitigation
techniques can then be relaxed or hardened based on the criticality
of the particular portions.
