
In recent years, flash-based key-value cache systems
have raised high interest in industry, such as Facebook’s
McDipper and Twitter’s Fatcache. These cache systems
typically use commercial SSDs to store and manage
key-value cache data in flash. Such a practice, though
simple, is inefficient due to the huge semantic gap
between the key-value cache manager and the underlying
flash devices. In this paper, we advocate to reconsider
the cache system design and directly open device-level
details of the underlying flash storage for key-value
caching. This co-design approach bridges the semantic
gap and well connects the two layers together, which
allows us to leverage both the domain knowledge of
key-value caches and the unique device properties. In
this way, we can maximize the efficiency of key-value
caching on flash devices while minimizing its weakness.
We implemented a prototype, called DIDACache, based
on the Open-Channel SSD platform. Our experiments on
real hardware show that we can significantly increase the
throughput by 35.5%, reduce the latency by 23.6%, and
remove unnecessary erase operations by 28%.
