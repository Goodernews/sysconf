
Simulation is a fast, controlled, and reproducible
way to evaluate new algorithms for distributed computing
platforms in a variety of conditions. However, the realism of
simulations is rarely assessed, which critically questions the
applicability of a whole range of findings.

In this paper, we present our efforts to build platform models
from application traces, to allow for the accurate simulation of
file transfers across a distributed infrastructure. File transfers
are key to performance, as the variability of file transfer times
has important consequences on the dataflow of the application.
We present a methodology to build realistic platform models
from application traces and provide a quantitative evaluation of
the accuracy of the derived simulations. Results show that the
proposed models are able to correctly capture real-life variability
and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art model.
