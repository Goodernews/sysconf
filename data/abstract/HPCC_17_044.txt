
 â€” Container technology has been prevalent and
widely-adopted in production environment considering the huge
benefits to application packing, deploying and management.
However, the deployment process is relatively slow by using
conventional approaches. In large-scale concurrent deployments,
resource contentions on the central image repository would
aggravate such situation. In fact, it is observable that the image
pulling operation is mainly responsible for the degraded
performance. To this end, we propose Cider - a novel deployment
system to enable rapid container deployment in a_ high
concurrent and scalable manner at scale. Firstly, on-demand
image data loading is proposed by altering the local Docker
storage of worker nodes into all-nodes-sharing network storage.
Also, the local copy-on-write layer for containers can ensure
Cider to achieve the scalability whilst improving the costeffectiveness during the holistic deployment. Experimental
results reveal that Cider can shorten the overall deployment time
by 85% and 62% on average when deploying one container and
100 concurrent containers respectively.
