trained. Such implementations can be very inefficient for online streaming applications demanding real-time guarantees, as the inclusion of each
new data point requires retraining of the model from scratch. This paper
focuses on the high-performance implementation of an accurate incremental SVM algorithm on Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors that efficiently
updates the trained SVM model with streaming data. We propose a
novel cycle break heuristic to fix an inherent drawback of the algorithm
that leads to a deadlock scenario which is not acceptable in real-world
applications. We further employ intelligent caching of dynamically changing data as well as other programming optimization ideas to speed up
the incremental SVM algorithm. Experiments on a number of real-world
datasets show that our implementation achieves high performance on
Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors (1.1 — 2.1x faster than Intel® Xeon®
processors) and is up to 2.1x faster than existing high-performance incremental algorithms while achieving comparable accuracy.
