
Apache HBase is a widely used non-relational
database in the Hadoop ecosystem. However, it will be inefficient
if users perform multidimensional queries. Some of existing
approaches incur extra costs in write performance or consistency
maintenance, others are limited to specific applications. In this
paper, we propose a novel data model called CFIDM, short for
Column Family Indexed Data Model. In CFIDM, we convert
the queried column into multiple column families. Values in the
specific column are partitioned. Each partition is manifested by
a column family, turning column family into an index with no
additional cost. Then we provide guides to build this data model.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness and versatility of CFIDM
on the Bixi data set and the TPC-DS benchmark. Results show
that CFIDM can save 6.6% disk space for Bixi and 35% for
TPC-DS, maximally speeding up the queries by 5X and 5.5X
respectively.
