a new source of big data is imminent—the machines and sensors
in the IoT ecosystem. The fundamental characteristic of the data
produced by these sources is that they are inherently geospatial in
nature. In addition, they exhibit unprecedented and unpredictable
skews. Thus, big data systems designed for IoT applications must
be able to efficiently ingest, index and query spatial data having
heavy and unpredictable skews. Spatial indexing is well explored
area of research in literature, but little attention has been given to
the topic of efficient distributed spatial indexing.

In this paper, we propose SIFT, a distributed spatial index and
its implementation. Unlike systems that depend on load balancing
mechanisms that kick-in post ingestion, S1FrT tries to distribute the
incoming data along the distributed structure at indexing time and
thus incurs minimal rebalancing overhead. Sirt depends only on
an underlying key-value store, hence is implementable in many
existing big data stores. Our evaluations of SirT on a popular open
source data store show promising results—SirT achieves up to 8x
reduction in indexing overhead while simultaneously reducing the
query latency and index size by over 2x and 3x respectively, in a
distributed environment compared to the state-of-the-art.
