
We introduce XTRAPULP, a new distributedmemory graph partitioner designed to process trillion-edge
graphs. XTRAPULP is based on the scalable label propagation
community detection technique, which has been demonstrated
as a viable means to produce high quality partitions with
minimal computation time. On a collection of large sparse graphs,
we show that XTRAPULP partitioning quality is comparable
to state-of-the-art partitioning methods. We also demonstrate
that XTRAPULP can produce partitions of real-world graphs
with billion+ vertices in minutes. Further, we show that using
XTRAPULP partitions for distributed-memory graph analytics
leads to significant end-to-end execution time reduction.
