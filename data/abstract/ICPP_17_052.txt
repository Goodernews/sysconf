
We present a scalable distributed memory
library for generating and computations involving structured dense matrices, such as those produced by boundary
integral equation formulations. Such matrices are dense,
but have special structure that can be exploited to obtain
efficient storage and matrix-vector product evaluations and
consequently the fast solution of linear systems. At the core
of the methods we use is the observation that off-diagonal
matrix blocks of such matrices have a low numerical rank,
and that this property can be exploited in a multi-level
fashion. In this work we focus on the Hierarchically SemiSeparable (HSS) representation. We present algorithms for
building and using HSS representations that are parallelized using MPI and CUDA to leverage state-of-the-art
heterogeneous clusters. The efficiency of our methods and
implementation is demonstrated on large dense matrices
obtained from a boundary integral equation formulation of
the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
We demonstrate excellent (linear) scalability on up to 128
GPUs on 128 nodes. Our codes will lay the foundation for
fast direct solvers for elliptic problems.
