
In prior-research the authors have demonstrated
that, for stencil-based numerical solvers for Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs), the parallel performance can be significantly
improved by selecting sub-domains that are not cubic in shape
(Saxena et. al., HPCS 2016, pp. 875-885). This is achieved through
accounting for cache utilization in both the message passing
and the computational kernel, where it is demonstrated that
the optimal domain decompositions not only depend on the
communication and load balance but also on the cache-misses,
amongst other factors. In this work we demonstrate that those
conclusions may also be extended to more advanced numerical
discretizations, based upon Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR).
In particular, we show that when basing our AMR strategy
on the local refinement of patches of the mesh, the optimal
patch shape is not typically cubic. We provide specific examples,
with accompanying explanation, to show that communication
minimizing strategies are not necessarily the best choice when
applying AMR in parallel. All numerical tests undertaken in this
work are based upon the open source BoxLib library.
