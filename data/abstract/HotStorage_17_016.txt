IO requests keeps storage performance bounded and
predictable, which is critical for infrastructure resource
planning. This work provides a transparent mechanism
for applications to pass prioritized IO commands to storage devices. As a consequence, we observe much shorter
tail latencies for prioritized IO while impacting nonprioritized IO in a reasonable manner. We also provide a
detailed description of the changes we made to the Linux
Kernel that enable applications to pass IO priorities to a
storage device. Our results show that passing priorities to
the storage device is capable of decreasing tail latencies
by a factor of 10x while decreasing IOPS minimally.
