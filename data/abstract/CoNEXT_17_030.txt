performs congestion-oblivious hashing of flows over multiple paths,
leading to an uneven distribution of traffic. Alternatives to ECMP
come with deployment challenges, as they require either changing
the tenant VM network stacks (e.g., MPTCP) or replacing all of
the switches (e.g., CONGA). We argue that the hypervisor provides
a unique point for implementing load-balancing algorithms that
are easy to deploy, while still reacting quickly to congestion. We
propose Clove, a scalable load-balancer that (i) runs entirely in the
hypervisor, requiring no modifications to tenant VM networking
stacks or physical switches, and (ii) works on any topology and
adapts quickly to topology changes and traffic shifts. Clove relies
on standard ECMP in physical switches, discovers paths using a
novel traceroute mechanism, uses software-based flowlet-switching,
and continuously learns congestion (or path utilization) state using
standard switch features. It then manipulates packet-header fields
in the hypervisor switch to direct traffic over less congested paths.
Clove achieves 1.5 to 7 times smaller flow-completion times at 70%
network load than other load-balancing algorithms that work with
existing hardware. Clove also captures some 80% of the performance
gain of best-of-breed hardware-based load-balancing algorithms like
CONGA that require new equipment.
