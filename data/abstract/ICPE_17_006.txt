instances offer significantly lower prices (up to 10 times lower)
than on-demand and reserved instances of comparable advertized
resource capacities. To use spot instances effectively, a tenant must
carefully weigh the lower costs of these instances against their poorer
availability. Towards this, we empirically study four features of
EC2 spot instance operation that a cost-conscious tenant may find
useful to model. Using extensive evaluation based on both historical and current spot instance data, we show shortcomings in the
state-of-the-art modeling of these features that we overcome. Our
analysis reveals many novel properties of spot instance operation
some of which offer predictive value while others do not. Using
these insights, we design predictors for our features that offer a
balance between computational efficiency (allowing for online resource procurement) and cost-efficacy. We explore “case studies”
wherein we implement prototypes of dynamic spot instance procurement advised by our predictors for two types of workloads.
Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach achieves (i) comparable cost but much better performance (fewer bid failures) for a
latency-sensitive in-memory Memcached cache, and (ii) an additional 18% cost-savings with comparable (if not better than) performance for a delay-tolerant batch workload.
