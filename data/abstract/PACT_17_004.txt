
Accurate, real-time Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) comes at a high energy cost, so accuracy has often to
be sacrificed in order to fit the strict power constraints of
mobile systems. However, accuracy is extremely important for
the end-user, and todayâ€™s systems are still unsatisfactory for
many applications. The most critical component of an ASR
system is the acoustic scoring, as it has a large impact on
the accuracy of the system and takes up the bulk of execution
time. The vast majority of ASR systems implement the acoustic
scoring by means of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where
the acoustic scores are obtained by evaluating multidimensional
Gaussian distributions.

In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator for GMM
evaluation that reduces the energy required for acoustic scoring
by three orders of magnitude compared to solutions based on
CPUs and GPUs. Our accelerator implements a lazy evaluation
scheme where Gaussians are computed on demand, avoiding
50% of the computations. Furthermore, it employs a novel
clustering scheme to reduce the size of the acoustic model,
which results in 8x memory bandwidth savings with a negligible
impact on accuracy. Finally, it includes a novel memoization
scheme that avoids 74.88% of floating-point operations. The
end design provides a 164x speedup and 3532x energy reduction
when compared with a highly-tuned implementation running
on a modern mobile CPU. Compared to a state-of-the-art
mobile GPU, the GMM accelerator achieves 5.89x speedup
over a highly optimized CUDA implementation, while reducing
energy by 241x.
