
The block incomplete Cholesky(BIC) is one of the most useful preconditioners for the conjugate gradient(CG) method.
Coloring algorithms are often used for parallelizing the BIC preconditioner, but they are the sequential algorithms. In this paper, we
proposed a hierarchical parallelization for coloring methods. Proposed method is versatile. We demonstrate that this method parallelize
traditional multi-coloring algorithms. Our numerical results confirm that the proposed method does not change the properties of the

coloring methods.
