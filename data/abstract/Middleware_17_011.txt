
Disaster Recovery (DR) is a crucial feature to ensure availability
and data protection in modern information systems. A common DR
approach requires the replication of services in a set of virtual machines running in the cloud as backups. This leads to considerable
monetary costs and managing efforts to keep such cloud VMs. We
present GINJA, a DR solution for transactional database management systems (DBMS) that uses only cloud storage services such
as Amazon S3. GINJA works at file-system level to efficiently capture and replicate data updates to a remote cloud storage service,
achieving three important goals: (1) reduces the costs for maintaining a cloud-based DR to less than one dollar per month for relevant
databasesâ€™ sizes and workloads (up to 222 x less than the traditional
approach of having a DBMS replica in a cloud VM); (2) allows a
precise control of the operational costs, durability and performance
trade-offs; and (3) introduces a small performance overhead to the
DBMS (e.g., less than 5% overhead for the TPC-C workload with ~
10 seconds of data loss in case of disasters).
