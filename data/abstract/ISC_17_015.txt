
. Numerical simulations present challenges because they generate petabyte-scale data that must be extracted and reduced during the
simulation. We demonstrate a seamless integration of feature extraction
for a simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics. The simulation produces on
the order of 6 TB per timestep. In order to analyze and store this data, we
extract velocity data from a dilated volume of the strong vortical regions
and also store a lossy compressed representation of the data. Both reduce
data by one or more orders of magnitude. We extract data from user checkpoints in transit while they reside on temporary burst buffer SSD stores.
In this way, analysis and compression algorithms are designed to meet specific time constraints so they do not interfere with simulation computations. Our results demonstrate that we can perform feature extraction on
a world-class direct numerical simulation of turbulence while it is running
and gather meaningful scientific data for archival and post analysis.
