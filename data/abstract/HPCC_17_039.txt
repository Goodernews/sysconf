
Virtual Data Center (VDC) is becoming the real
world tendency of IT model that offers flexible and on-demand
service, most of which adopt Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
as their network architecture to simplify network management
and ensure network isolation. In our paper, by following our
Just-in-Time Architecture (JITA) design, we further studied the
composable architecture in optical domain. For this architecture
to work efficiently, Terabit per second (Tbps) bandwidth and
negligible latency (i.e., less than microsecond latency) are needed
to support disaggregated infrastructures. Therefore, in this paper,
we present an all-optical packets switch solution with proposed
SDN controlling scheme. The modeling of the all-optical switch is
also proposed, implemented and studied. Based on the modeling
of the switch, the output Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR)
and latency performance are studied. With the result of the
simulation, we find the limits and dominated factors for designing
the large scale all-optical switch in the composable data centers.
An example of analyzing the maximum throughput and the
latency of the all-optical switch is given at the end.
