
The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) is
participating to the increase of data- and energy-hungry
applications. As connected devices do not yet offer enough
capabilities for sustaining these applications, users perform
computation offloading to the cloud. To avoid network bottlenecks and reduce the costs associated to data movement, edge
cloud solutions have started being deployed, thus improving the
Quality of Service. In this paper, we advocate for leveraging
on-site renewable energy production in the different edge cloud
nodes to green IoT systems while offering improved QoS
compared to core cloud solutions. We propose an analytic
model to decide whether to offload computation from the
objects to the edge or to the core Cloud, depending on the
renewable energy availability and the desired application QoS.
This model is validated on our application use-case that deals
with video stream analysis from vehicle cameras.
