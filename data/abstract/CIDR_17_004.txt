
While data volumes continue to rise, the capacity of human attention
remains limited. As a result, users need analytics engines that can
assist in prioritizing attention in this fast data that is too large for
manual inspection. We present a set of design principles for the
design of fast data analytics engines that leverage the relative scarcity
of human attention and overabundance of data: return fewer results,
prioritize iterative analysis, and filter fast to compute less. We report
on our early experiences employing these principles in the design
and deployment of MacroBase, an open source analysis engine for
prioritizing attention in fast data. By combining streaming operators
for feature transformation, classification, and data summarization,
MacroBase provides users with interpretable explanations of key
behaviors, acting as a search engine for fast data.
