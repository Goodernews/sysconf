
. The reduction of the CPU frequency and voltage is a wellknown approach to improve energy consumption of memory-bound applications. This is based on the conception that the performance of the main
memory sees little or no degradation at reduced processor clock speeds
while power consumption decreases significantly improving the overall
energy efficiency. We study this effect on the Haswell generation of Intel
Xeon processors as well as the ARMv7 generation of the 32-bit ARM
big.LITTLE architecture. The goal is to analyse and compare computational performance, energy consumption and energy efficiency on a series
of tasks, each focusing on different parts of the system and provide an
analysis and generalisation to other similar architectures.

The benchmark suit consists of compute and memory intensive benchmarks as well as both single and multi-threaded scientific applications.
The results show that frequency and voltage scaling can significantly
improve algorithmsâ€™ energy efficiency. Up to 2.5x on ARM and 1.5x
on Intel compared to the maximum frequency. ARM is up to 2x more
efficient than Intel.
