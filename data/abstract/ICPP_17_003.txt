
This paper implements a Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics simulation code and distributes it on a
heterogeneous cluster. The theoretical analysis results show
that treating GPU as equivalent peer of CPU rather than an
assistant or a substitute is the most efficient way of using a
CPU+GPU compute node. However, it raises complex
challenges of heterogeneous cooperation. Our strategies of
hybrid-level domain decomposition, multi-stage thread pool
and data transfer optimization are addressed and the
respective effects are showed. Steady balance ratio of 1.1
between 6 nodes and GPU workload ratio of 0.43 between
2CPU+1GPU cards are observed. Average speedups of 2.9x,
1.81x, 1.1x over the single GPU version are obtained on three
heterogeneous systems. The weak scaling tests are carried out
on 1 to 16384 CPU-GPU nodes and the overall parallel
efficiency of 70.3% is achieved.
