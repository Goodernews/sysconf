the chance that users make false discoveries. They allow users
to (visually) examine many hypotheses and make inference with
simple interactions, and thus incur the issue commonly known in
Statistics as the “multiple hypothesis testing error.” In this work, we
propose a solution to integrate the control of multiple hypothesis
testing into interactive data exploration systems. A key insight is
that existing methods for controlling the false discovery rate (such
as FDR) are not directly applicable to interactive data exploration.
We therefore discuss a set of new control procedures that are better
suited for this task and integrate them in our system, QUDE. Via
extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets we
demonstrate how QUDE can help experts and novice users alike to
efficiently control false discoveries.
