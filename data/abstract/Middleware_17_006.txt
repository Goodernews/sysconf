
Traditionally, active storage techniques have been proposed to move
computation tasks to storage nodes in order to exploit data locality.
However, we argue in this paper that active storage is ill-suited for
cloud storage for two reasons: 1. Lack of elasticity: Computing can
only scale out with the number of storage nodes; and 2. Resource
Contention: Sharing compute resources can produce interferences
in the storage system. Serverless computing is now emerging as a
promising alternative for ensuring painless scalability, and also, for
simplifying the development of disaggregated computing tasks.

Here we present an innovative data-driven serverless computing
middleware for object storage. It is a lightweight compute solution
that allows users to create small, stateless functions that intercept
and operate on data flows in a scalable manner without the need
to manage a server or a runtime environment. We demonstrate
through different use cases how our solution scales with minimal
overhead, while getting rid of the resource contention problems
incurred by active storage tasks.
