
High-speed interconnects (e.g. InfiniBand) have
been widely deployed on modern HPC clusters. With the
emergence of HPC in the cloud, high-speed interconnects
have paved their way into the cloud with recently introduced
Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) technology, which is
able to provide efficient sharing of high-speed interconnect
resources and achieve near-native I/O performance. However,
recent studies have shown that SR-IOV-based virtual networks
prevent virtual machine migration, which is an essential virtualization capability towards high availability and resource
provisioning. Although several initial solutions have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem, our investigations
show that there are still many restrictions on these proposed
approaches, such as depending on specific network adapters
and/or hypervisors, which will limit the usage scope of these
solutions on HPC environments. In this paper, we propose a
high-performance virtual machine migration framework for
MPI applications on SR-IOV enabled InfiniBand clusters.
Our proposed method does not need any modification to
the hypervisor and InfiniBand drivers and it can efficiently
handle virtual machine (VM) migration with SR-IOV IB device.
Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed design is
able to not only achieve fast VM migration speed but also
guarantee the high performance for MPI applications during
the migration in the HPC cloud. At the application level, for
NPB LU benchmark running inside VM, our proposed design
is able to completely hide the migration overhead through
the computation and migration overlapping. Furthermore, our
proposed design shows good scaling when migrating multiple
VMs.
