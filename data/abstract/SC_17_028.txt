
Tuning application parameters for optimal performance is a challenging combinatorial problem. Hence, techniques for modeling
the functional relationships between various input features in the
parameter space and application performance are important. We
show that simple statistical inference techniques are inadequate to
capture these relationships. Even with more complex ensembles
of models, the minimum coverage of the parameter space required
via experimental observations is still quite large. We propose a
deep learning based approach that can combine information from
exhaustive observations collected at a smaller scale with limited
observations collected at a larger target scale. The proposed approach is able to accurately predict performance in the regimes of
interest to performance analysts while outperforming many traditional techniques. In particular, our approach can identify the best
performing configurations even when trained using as few as 1%
of observations at the target scale.
