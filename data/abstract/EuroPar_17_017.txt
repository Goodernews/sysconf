
. In a Cloud computing data center and especially in a IaaS
(Infrastructure as a Service), performance predictability is one of the most
important challenges. For a given allocated virtual machine (VM) in one
laaS, a client expects his application to perform identically whatever is
the hosting physical server or its resource management strategy. However, performance predictability is very difficult to enforce in a heterogeneous hardware environment where machines do not have identical performance characteristics, and even more difficult when machines are internally heterogeneous as for Asymmetric Multicore Processor machines.
In this paper, we introduce a VM scheduler extension which takes into
account hardware performance heterogeneity of Asymmetric Multicore
Processor machines in the cloud. Based on our analysis of the problem,
we designed and implemented two solutions: the first weights CPU allocations according to core performance, while the second adapts CPU allocations to reach a given instruction execution rate (Ips) regardless the
core types. We demonstrate that such scheduler extensions can enforce
predictability with a negligible overhead on application performance.
