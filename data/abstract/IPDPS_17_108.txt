
In this paper we present Mimir, a new implementation of MapReduce over MPI. Mimir inherits the core principles
of existing MapReduce frameworks, such as MR-MPI, while
redesigning the execution model to incorporate a number of
sophisticated optimization techniques that achieve similar or
better performance with significant reduction in the amount of
memory used. Consequently, Mimir allows significantly larger
problems to be executed in memory, achieving large performance
gains. We evaluate Mimir with three benchmarks on two highend platforms to demonstrate its superiority compared with that
of other frameworks.
