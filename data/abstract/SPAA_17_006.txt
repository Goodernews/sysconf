problem. The input of the problem is a set of jobs, each having an
arrival time, a starting deadline and a processing length. Each job
has to be started by the scheduler between its arrival and its starting
deadline. Once started, the job runs for a period of the processing
length without interruption. The target is to minimize the span of
all the jobs — the time duration in which at least one job is running.
We study online FJS under both the non-clairvoyant and clairvoyant
settings. In the non-clairvoyant setting, the processing length of
each job is not known for scheduling purposes. We first establish
a lower bound of : on the competitive ratio of any deterministic
online scheduler, where p is the max/min job processing length ratio.
Then, we propose two O()-competitive schedulers: Batch and
Batch+. The Batch+ scheduler is proved to have a tight competitive
ratio of (uz + 1). In the clairvoyant setting, the processing length
of each job is known at its arrival and can be used for scheduling purposes. We establish a lower bound of “>— on the competitive
ratio of any deterministic online scheduler, and propose two O(1)competitive schedulers: Classify-by-Duration Batch+ and Profit. The
Profit scheduler can achieve a competitive ratio of 4+2V2. Our work
lays the foundation for extending several online job scheduling
problems in cloud and energy-efficient computing to jobs that have
laxity in starting.
