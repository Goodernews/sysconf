performance benefits. Despite initial efforts in both industry and
academia, we remain unsure how to integrate middleboxes into
secure sessions—it is not even clear how to define “secure” in this
multi-entity context.

In this paper, we first describe a design space for secure multientity communication protocols, highlighting tradeoffs between
mutually incompatible properties. We then target real-world requirements unmet by existing protocols, like outsourcing middleboxes to untrusted infrastructure and supporting legacy clients. We
propose a security definition and present Middlebox TLS (mbTLS),
a protocol that provides it (in part by using Intel SGX to protect
middleboxes from untrusted hardware). We show that mbTLS is
deployable today and introduces little overhead, and we describe
our experience building a simple mbTLS HTTP proxy.
