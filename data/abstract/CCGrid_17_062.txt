
Consolidating applications of conflicting service level
objectives (SLOs) to share virtualized resources in cloud datacenters requires efficient resource management to ensure overall high
Quality-of-Service (QoS). Applications of different performance
targets often exhibit different resource demands. Thus, it is not
trivial to translate individual application SLOs to corresponding
resource shares in a shared virtualized environment to meet
performance targets. In this paper, we present CéiriCloud, a
performance-aware resource controlling system, that adaptively
allocates resources, with a resource-share controller and an allocation optimization model. The controller automatically adapts
resource demands based on performance deviations, while the
optimization model resolves conflicts in resource demands from
multiple co-located applications based on their ongoing performance achieved. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of
CtrlCloud in Python on top of Xen hypervisor. Our experimental
results indicate that CtrlCloud can optimize allocations of CPU
resources across multiple applications to maintain the 95th
percentile latency within predefined SLO targets. CtriCloud
also provides QoS differentiation and yet fulfilling of CPU
share demands from applications is maximized given resource
availability. We further compare CtriCloud against two other
resource allocation methods commonly used in current clouds.
CtrlCloud improves resource utilization by allocating resource
shares optimal to ‘actual needs’ as it employs share-performance
online modeling.
