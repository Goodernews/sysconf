
Elastic distributed storage systems have been increasingly studied in recent years because power consumption
has become a major problem in data centers. Much progress
has been made in improving the agility of resizing small- and
large-scale distributed storage systems. However, most of these
studies focus on metadata based distributed storage systems. On
the other hand, emerging consistent hashing based distributed
storage systems are considered to allow better scalability and are
highly attractive. We identify challenges in achieving elasticity
in consistent hashing based distributed storage. These challenges
cannot be easily solved by techniques used in current studies.
In this paper, we propose an elastic consistent hashing based
distributed storage to solve two problems. First, in order to
allow a distributed storage to resize quickly, we modify the
data placement algorithm using a primary server design and
achieve an egual-work data layout. Second, we propose a selective
data re-integration technique to reduce the performance impact
when resizing a cluster. Our experimental and trace analysis
results confirm that our proposed elastic consistent hashing works
effectively and allows significantly better elasticity.
