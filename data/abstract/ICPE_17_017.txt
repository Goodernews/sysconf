
Tactical Operations Center (TOC) system in military field is
an advanced computer system composed of multiple servers
and desktops to interlock internal/external weapon systems
processing mission-critical applications in combat situation.
However, the current TOC system has several limitations
such as difficulty of integrating tactical weapon systems including missile launch system and radar system into the
single TOC system due to the heterogeneity of HW and
SW between systems, and an inefficient computing resource
management for the weapon systems.
In this paper, we proposed a novel HPC supported missioncritical Cloud architecture as TOC for Surface-to-Air-Missile
(SAM) system with OpenStack Cloud OS, Data Distribution
Service (DDS), and GPU virtualization techniques. With
this approach, our system provides elastic resource management over the weapon systems with virtual machines,
integration of heterogeneous systems with different kinds of
guest OS, real-time, reliable, and high-speed communication
between the virtual machines and virtualized GPU resource
over the virtual machines. Evaluation of our TOC system includes DDS performance measurement over 10Gbps
Ethernet and QDR InfiniBand networks on the virtualized
environment with OpenStack Cloud OS, and GPU virtualization performance evaluation with two different methods,
PCI pass-through and remote-API. With the evaluation results, we conclude that our system provides reasonable performance in the combat situation compared to the previous
TOC system while additionally supports scalable and elastic
use of computing resource through the virtual machines.
