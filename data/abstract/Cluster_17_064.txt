construct an exascale computing platform will pose significant
resilience challenges. In addition to slowdowns associated with
detected errors, silent errors are likely to further degrade application performance. Moreover, silent data corruption (SDC) has
the potential to undermine the integrity of the results produced
by important scientific applications.

In this paper, we propose an application-independent mechanism to efficiently detect and correct SDC in read-mostly
memory, where SDC may be most likely to occur. We use
memory protection mechanisms to maintain compressed backups
of application memory. We detect SDC by identifying changes
in memory contents that occur without explicit write operations.
We demonstrate that, for several applications, our approach can
potentially protect a significant fraction of application memory
pages from SDC with modest overheads. Moreover, our proposed
technique can be straightforwardly combined with many other
approaches to provide a significant bulwark against SDC.
