transparently incorporates cryptography to enforce confidentiality
and integrity policies on untrusted storage. Cuio insulates developers from explicitly manipulating keys and cryptographic primitives
by leveraging the policy language of the IFC system to automatically use the appropriate keys and correct cryptographic operations.
We prove that Cio is secure with a novel proof technique that is
based on a proof style from cryptography together with standard
programming languages results. We present a prototype Cuio implementation and a case study that demonstrates CL1oâ€™s practicality.
