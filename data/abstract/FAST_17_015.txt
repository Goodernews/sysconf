
This paper describes Mirador, a dynamic placement
service implemented as part of an enterprise scale-out
storage product. Mirador is able to encode multidimensional placement goals relating to the performance, failure response, and workload adaptation of the
storage system. Using approaches from dynamic constraint satisfaction, Mirador migrates both data and client
network connections in order to continuously adapt and
improve the configuration of the storage system.
