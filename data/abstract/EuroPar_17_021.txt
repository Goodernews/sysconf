deployment strategies of memcached-like in-memory storage for Hadoop
on supercomputers, where each node often does not have a local disk
but shares a slow central disk. For the experiments, we developed our
own memcached-like file system, named SEMem, for Hadoop. Since
SEMem was designed for supercomputers, it uses MPI for communication. SEMem is configurable to adopt various deployment strategies and
our experiments revealed that a good deployment strategy was allocating some nodes that work only for in-memory storage but do not directly
perform map-reduce computation.
