mapping for a Sierpitski gasket fractal embedded in a discrete
Euclidean space of n x n. A block-space map \ : Zz +> Z? is
proposed, from Euclidean parallel space E to embedded fractal
space F, that maps in O(log, log.(n)) time and uses no more
than O(n™) threads with H ~ 1.58... being the Hausdorff
dimension, making it parallel space efficient. When compared to
a bounding-box map, \(w) offers a sub-exponential improvement
in parallel space and a monotonically increasing speedup once
nm > no. Experimental performance tests show that in practice
A(w) can produce performance improvement at any block-size
once n > no = 2°, reaching approximately 10x of speedup for
n = 2'© under typical block configurations.
