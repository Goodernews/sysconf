
A significant fraction of the operational expenditures
incurred by cloud service providers relates to their networking
(Internet access) and electricity consumption. Both depend on
the peak-demand over the billing interval. In the future, cloud
services providers may in turn recoup these costs from their
long-term customers through peak-based pricing. We explore two
different methods for the cloud provider to recoup this charge:
(i) equal allocation and (ii) proportional to usage allocation.
Furthermore, we consider multiple strategic tenants whose active
demand response to cloud price settings jointly depends on job
responsiveness (modeled as queueing delay of admitted jobs)
and lost/shed workload (due to excessive delay). Under certain
conditions, we prove existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria
for regimes (i) and (ii). Due to nonconvexity in the utility (or
cost) functions, existence statements require leveraging potentiality arguments while uniqueness statements rely on imposing
further convexity requirements. The resulting Nash equilibrium
is parametrized by the price per unit demand, which may be
strategically set by the cloud to maximize its revenue subject
to tenants reaching a Nash equilibrium. We model the resulting
interactions as a Stackelberg game between the cloud and a set of
tenants. A relatively general existence statement is provided for
the Stackelberg equilibrium under regime (i). For a special case of
regime (ii), the unique Stackelberg equilibrium is characterized.
Finally, we provide a numerical study for such a framework
using real-world peak-based prices from an electric utility and
demands given by Google workload traces.
