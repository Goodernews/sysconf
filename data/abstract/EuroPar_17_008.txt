
. Large scale distributed systems are expected to consume
huge amounts of energy. To solve this issue, shutdown policies constitute an appealing approach able to dynamically adapt the resource set
to the actual workload. However, multiple constraints have to be taken
into account for such policies to be applied on real infrastructures, in particular the time and energy cost of shutting down and waking up nodes,
and power capping to avoid disruption of the system. In this paper, we
propose models translating these various constraints into different shutdown policies that can be combined. Our models are validated through
simulations on real workload traces and power measurements on real
testbeds.
