
We propose a model for scheduling jobs in a
parallel machine setting that takes into account the cost of
migrations by assuming that the processing time of a job
may depend on the specific set of machines among which
the job is migrated. For the makespan minimization objective,
the model generalizes classical scheduling problems such as
unrelated parallel machine scheduling, as well as novel ones
such as semi-partitioned and clustered scheduling. In the case
of a hierarchical family of machines, we derive a compact
integer linear programming formulation of the problem and
leverage its fractional relaxation to obtain a polynomial-time 2approximation algorithm. Extensions that incorporate memory
capacity constraints are also discussed.
