
The rising popularity of large-scale real-time analytics applications (real-time inventory/pricing, mobile apps that give
you suggestions, fraud detection, risk analysis, etc.) emphasize the need for distributed data management systems that
can handle fast transactions and analytics concurrently. Efficient processing of transactional and analytical requests,
however, require different optimizations and architectural
decisions in a system. This paper presents the Wildfire
system, which targets Hybrid Transactional and Analytical
Processing (HTAP). Wildfire leverages the Spark ecosystem
to enable large-scale data processing with different types of
complex analytical requests, and columnar data processing
to enable fast transactions and analytics concurrently.
