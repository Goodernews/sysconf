
This paper introduces an approach that handles
with the trustworthy cloud service selection issue in Cloud
computing environments. Despite the fact that most of the
existing trust systems consider several QoS attributes for trust
computing, none of them did consider the correlation that may
exist among these attributes. However, we demonstrate in this
paper that the integration of correlation between QoS attributes
in trust computing significantly helps to solve many issues such
as predicting missing assessment, detecting malicious feedbacks
and improving the accuracy of trust values. The main goal of
this paper is to show the significance of correlation between
those attributes for trust computing. To do that, we propose
combining both the popular Naive Bayes model and the ngram Markov model to design a more efficient trust model for
cloud environments. Our proposed trust model also takes into
account the user’s requirements, aggregates both the qualitative
and quantitative assessment, and considers several sources when
computing cloud services’ trust values. Experimental results show
that our proposed approach outperforms the traditional Naive
Bayes trust models.
