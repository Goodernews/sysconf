
Storage disaggregation separates compute and storage to di
erent nodes in order to allow for independent resource scaling and thus, better hardware resource utilization. While
disaggregation o hard-drives storage is a common practice,
NVM-SSD (i.e., PCle-based SSD) disaggregation is considered more challenging. This is because SSDs are signiicantly
aster than hard drives, so the latency overheads (due to
both network and CPU processing) as well as the extra
compute cycles needed or the offloading stack become much
more pronounced.

In this work we characterize the overheads o NVMe-SSD
disaggregation. We show that NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVM)
—a recently-released remote storage protocol speciication —
reduces the overheads o remote access to a bare minimum,
thus greatly increasing the cost-eficiency of Flash disaggregation. Specifically, while recent work showed that SSD
storage disaggregation via iSCSI degrades application-level
throughput by 20%, we report on negligible perormance
degradation with NVM — both when using stress-tests as
well as with a more-realistic KV-store workload.
