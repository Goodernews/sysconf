triangulations of a graph in incremental polynomial time.
Consequently, we get an algorithm for enumerating all the
proper tree decompositions, in incremental polynomial time,
where “proper” means that the tree decomposition cannot be
improved by removing or splitting a bag. The algorithm can
incorporate any method for (ordinary, single result) triangulation or tree decomposition, and can serve as an anytime
algorithm to improve such a method. We describe an extensive experimental study of an implementation on real data
from different fields. Our experiments show that the algorithm improves upon central quality measures over the underlying tree decompositions, and is able to produce a large
number of high-quality decompositions.
