
Low-energy computing in the use phase is compelling because it helps to address thermal density issues of
deeply scaled CMOS, maximizes battery-life of mobile computing
platforms, while also addressing sustainability. Unfortunately,
environmental impacts of fabricating CMOS integrated circuits
(Cs) is increasing and rapidly catching the operational phase
of computing systems, particularly for low-energy and mobile
computing products. This is due to trends in fabrication techniques for increasingly small geometries, such as increasing
photo-lithography and metrology costs. Without attention, IC
fabrication will likely become the dominant energy consumer
and source of carbon emissions over an ICâ€™s lifetime. We propose
a scaled parameterized model for evaluating the environmental
impacts of IC fabrication, which can scale from 130nm to
32nm technology and account for stepwise changes in process
technologies. As an example of the type of analysis possible
using this model we demonstrate the environmental impacts
of changing the metal stack at these technology nodes. Our
results indicate that based on the die area calculated from a
commercial design flow and our parameterized model, changing
the number of metal layers from eight to six layers results in an
average savings in manufacturing energy of 9.5%, 13.8%, and
13% for 130nm, 90nm, and 65nm technologies, respectively, and,
depending on scenario, it can take years for operational energy
savings to makeup this difference.
