
 Why did my workload run so slowly? Is hardware degradation

Users often struggle to reason about the performance of today’s
systems. Without an understanding of what factors are most important to performance, users do not know how to tune their system’s
hardware and software configuration to improve performance. We
argue that performance clarity — making it easy to understand where
bottlenecks lie and the performance implications of various system
changes — should be a first class design goal. To illustrate that this is
possible, we propose an architecture for data analytics frameworks
in which jobs are decomposed into schedulable units called monotasks that each consume a single resource. By untangling the use of
different resources, using monotasks allows the system to trivially
report time used on each resource and the resource bottleneck. Our
prototype implementation of monotasks for Apache Spark is APIcompatible and achieves performance parity with Spark, and yields
a simple performance model that can predict the effects of future
hardware and software changes.
