time, a number of techniques have been developed to estimate the
expected number of program/erase cycles under typical usage patterns, and sufficiently over-provision the cells such that the device
meets its expected lifespan, even if individual cells fail. This paper
started as a simple experiment: measuring whether the lifespan of
flash devices in smartphones and other mobile devices, match the
estimates. To our surprise, we find that, in a matter of days, simple,
unprivileged applications can render the drive of several smartphones (and thus, the phone) inoperable. This result is concerning,
as it means that installing malicious or poorly-written software
could destroy the device itself. We experimentally demonstrate
the problem, discuss reasons why it occurs, and consider potential
solutions.
