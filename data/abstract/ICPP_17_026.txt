effective for supporting data intensive in-situ workflows
and coupling of applications. Experimental sciences
are increasingly becoming collaborative among geographically distributed teams, and include experimental instruments and HPC facilities. This new way of
doing science poses new challenges due to data sizes,
complexity of computation, and the use of wide area
networks between couplings. In this paper, we explore
how the staging abstraction can be extended to support
such workflows. Specifically, we develop a NUMA-like
abstraction that orchestrates multiple distributed localarea staging abstractions, and provides asynchronous
data put/get semantics to enable data sharing across
them. To mask data movement overhead and provide
in-time data access, we propose the use of predictive
prefetching approaches that leverage the iterative nature of the coupling. We evaluate our prototype implementation using a fusion workflow and show that our
design can effectively and transparently support widearea coupled workflows. Additionally, results show that
the use of prefetching techniques leads to significant
gains in data access times of data that needs to be
moved over the wide area network.
