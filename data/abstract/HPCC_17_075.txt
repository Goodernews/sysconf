satisfaction of their timing constraints. However, novel speed-up
hardware architectures and software mechanism, which target
improving average-case performances, ignore and sometimes
worsen the ability to obtain guarantees. An alternative approach
is the Logical Execution Time (LET) model, but there are some
deficiencies in existing LET-based development tools. In this
paper, we propose a novel LET-based time-aware programming
framework called TipFrame. The framework introduces Servants
to improve the responsiveness of LET-based periodic tasks further. The runtime makes behaviors in the system level consistent
with the semantics of LET model for predictability. TipFrame
implements in C language providing time-aware programming
interfaces called TipFrame-C. The programming paradigm of
TipFrame-C is described using an autopilot avionic control
system. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach is
effective and efficient to construct LET-based real-time systems.
