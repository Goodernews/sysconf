across data-centers o different cloud providers empowers
Internet applications to choose data centers (DCs) and storage services based on storage needs. However, using multiple storage services across multiple data centers brings a
complex data placement problem that depends on a large
number o factors including, e.g., desired goals, storage and
network characteristics, and pricing policies. In addition,
dynamics e.g., changing user locations and access patterns,
make it impossible to determine the best data placement
statically. In this paper, we present TripS, a lightweight
system that considers both data center locations and storage tiers to determine the data placement or geo-distributed
storage systems. Such systems make use o TripS by providing inputs including SLA, consistency model, fault tolerance,
latency inormation, and cost information. With given inputs, TripS models and solves the data placement problem
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to determine data placement. In addition, to adapt quickly to dynamics, we introduce the notion o Target Locale List (TLL),
a pro-active approach to avoid expensive re-evaluation o
the optimal placement. The TripS prototype is running on
Wiera, a policy driven geo-distributed storage system, to
show how a storage system can easily utilize TripS or data
placement. We evaluate TripS/Wiera on multiple data centers o AWS and Azure. The results show that TripS/Wiera
can reduce cost 14.96% ~ 98.1% based on workloads in comparison with other worksâ€™ approaches and can handle both
short- and long-term dynamics to avoid SLA violations.
