the role of geolocation in social networks, resulting in new commercial applications; for example, marketers can identify current
trending topics within a region of interest and focus their products
accordingly. In this paper we study a basic analytics query on geotagged data, namely: given a spatiotemporal region, find the most
frequent terms among the social posts in that region. While there
has been prior work on keyword search on spatial data (find the objects nearest to the query point that contain the query keywords),
and on group keyword search on spatial data (retrieving groups of
objects), our problem is different in that it returns keywords and
aggregated frequencies as output, instead of having the keyword
as input. Moreover, we differ from works addressing the streamed
version of this query in that we operate on large, disk resident data
and we provide exact answers. We propose an index structure and
algorithms to efficiently answer such top-k spatiotemporal range
queries, which we refer as Top-k Frequent Spatiotemporal Terms
(KFST) queries. Our index structure employs an R-tree augmented
by top-k sorted term lists (STLs), where a key challenge is to balance the size of the index to achieve faster execution and smaller
space requirements. We theoretically study and experimentally validate the ideal length of the stored term lists, and perform detailed
experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods
compared to baselines on real datasets.
