accurate relative localization. Most of the studies in the area focus
on indoor positioning and rely on two important assumptions: (i)
lights are static, and (ii) the receiver has line-of-sight with multiple lights. These requirements limit the application of localization
methods in scenarios where nodes have a single light and are mobile,
such as motorbikes or swarms of robots. In general, this particular
type of scenarios (single lights moving on a plane) leads to underdetermined localization systems where no unique solution can be
found. We follow a holistic approach that includes theory, simulations, and experiments to overcome some of the limitations present
in such type of scenarios. Our theoretical and simulation results
show that if nodes are enhanced with sensors providing relative
directions (such as compasses), we can derive dependencies in the
system to obtain unique solutions. Our proof-of-concept implementation validates our model by showing that single lights can provide
relative localization with high accuracy: an average error below
53cm.
