
The performance of an OSâ€™s networking stack can be
measured by its achieved throughput, CPU utilization,
latency, and per-flow fairness. To be able to drive increasing line-rates at 10Gbps and beyond, modern OS
networking stacks rely on a number of important hardware and software optimizations, including but not limited to using multiple transmit and receive queues and
segmentation offloading. Unfortunately, we have observed that these optimizations lead to substantial flowlevel unfairness.

We describe Titan, an extension to the Linux networking stack that systematically addresses unfairness arising
in different operating conditions. Across both fine and
coarse timescales and when NIC queues are undersubscribed and oversubscribed, we find that the Titan can
reduce unfairness by 58% or more when compared with
the best performing Linux configuration. We also find
that improving fairness can lead to a reduction in tail
flow completion times for flows in an all-to-all shuffle
in a cluster of servers.
