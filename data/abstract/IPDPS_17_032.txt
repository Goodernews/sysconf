
Many applications have irregular behavior — e.g.,
input-dependent solvers, irregular memory accesses, or unbiased
branches — that cannot be captured using today’s automated
performance modeling techniques. We describe new hierarchical
critical path analyses for the Palm model generation tool. To
obtain a good tradeoff between model accuracy, generality,
and generation cost, we combine static and dynamic analysis.
To create a model’s outer structure, we capture tasks along
representative MPI critical paths. We create a histogram of
critical tasks with parameterized task arguments and instance
counts. To model each task, we identify hot instruction-level
paths and model each path based on data flow, data locality, and
microarchitectural constraints. We describe application models
that generate accurate predictions for strong scaling when
varying CPU speed, cache and memory speed, microarchitecture,
and (with supervision) input data class. Our models’ errors are
usually below 8%; and always below 13%.
