
. This paper describes a cache-line conflict profiling method
that advances the state of the art performance tuning workflow by accurately highlighting the sources of conflicts. The basic idea behind this is
the use of cache simulators as a diagnosis tool for cache-line conflicts.
We also propose a mechanism that enables to identify where line conflict misses are incurred and the reasons why the conflicts occur. We
evaluate our conflict simulator using some of the benchmark codes used
in the HPC field. From the results, we confirm that our simulator can
accurately model the cache behaviors that cause line conflicts and reveal
the sources of them during the execution. Finally, we demonstrate that
optimizations assisted by our mechanism contribute to improving performance for both of serial and parallel executions.
