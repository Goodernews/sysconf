
A major concern for todayâ€™s smartphones is their
much faster battery drain than traditional feature phones,
despite their greater battery capacities. The difference is mainly
contributed by those more powerful but also much more powerconsuming smartphone components, such as the multi-core application processor. While the application processor must be active
when any smart apps are being used, it is also unnecessarily
waken up, even during idle periods, to perform operations related
to basic phone functions (i.e., incoming calls and text messages).

In this paper, we investigate how to increase the battery life of
smartphones by minimizing the use of the application processor
during idle periods. We find that the application processor is often
waken up by a process running on it, called the Radio Interface
Layer Daemon (RILD), which interfaces the user and apps to the
GSM/LTE cellular network. In particular, we demonstrate that a
great amount of energy could be saved if RILD is stopped, such
that the application processor can sleep more often. Based on this
key finding, we design a Smart On Demand (SOD) configuration
that reduces smartphone idle energy consumption by running
RILD operations on a secondary low-power microcontroller. As
a result, RILD operations can be handled at much lower energy
costs and the application processor is waken up only when one
needs to use any smart apps, in an on-demand manner. We have
built a hardware prototype of SOD and evaluated it with real
user traces. Our results show that SOD can increase its battery
life by up to 2.5 more days.
