Memory (DORAM) data structure that is optimized for use in twoparty secure computation protocols. We improve upon the access
time of previous constructions by a factor of up to ten, their memory
overhead by a factor of one hundred or more, and their initialization
time by a factor of thousands. We are able to instantiate ORAMs
that hold 234 bytes, and perform operations on them in seconds,
which was not previously feasible with any implemented scheme.

Unlike prior ORAM constructions based on hierarchical hashing [19], permutation [19], or trees [39], our Distributed ORAM is
derived from the new Function Secret Sharing scheme introduced
by Boyle, Gilboa and Ishai [11, 12]. This significantly reduces the
amount of secure computation required to implement an ORAM
access, albeit at the cost of O(n) efficient local memory operations.

We implement our construction and find that, despite its poor
O(n) asymptotic complexity, it still outperforms the fastest previously known constructions, Circuit ORAM [42] and Square-root
ORAM [55], for datasets that are 32 KiB or larger, and outperforms
prior work on applications such as stable matching [16] or binary
search [23] by factors of two to ten.
