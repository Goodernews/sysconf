resources invested into troubleshooting. Hence, aster troubleshooting of software misconfigurations has been critically
important or the customers as well as the vendors.

This paper introduces a ramework and a tool called Dexter, which embraces the recent trend of viewing systems as
data to derive the troubleshooting clues. Dexter provides
quick insights into the problem root cause and possible resolution by solely using the storage system logs. This diferentiates Dexter from other previously known approaches
which complement log analysis with source code analysis,
execution traces etc. Furthermore, Dexter analyzes command history logs rom the sick system after it has been
healed and predicts the exact command(s) which resolved
the problem. Dexter’s approach is simple and can be applied
to other sotware systems with diagnostic logs for immediate
problem detection without any pre-trained models.

Evaluation on 600 real customer support cases shows 90%
accuracy in root causing and over 65% accuracy in inding
an exact resolution or the misconfiguration problem. Results show up to 60% noise reduction in system logs and
at least 10z savings in case resolution times, bringing down
the troubleshooting times rom days to minutes at times.
Dexter runs 24x7 in the NetApp’s® support data center.

The paper also presents insights rom study on thousands
o real customer support cases over thousands of deployed
systems over the period o 1.5 years. These investigations
uncover acts that cause potential delays in customer case
resolutions and inluence Dexter’s design.
