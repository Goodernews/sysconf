into market-like environments that offer a wide range of
server contracts. Amazon EC2’s spot market is the clearest example of this trend: it operates over 5000 markets
globally where users can rent servers for a variable price.
To exploit spot instances, while mitigating the risk of
price spikes and revocations, many researchers and startups have developed techniques for modeling and predicting prices to optimize spot server selection. However,
prior approaches focus largely on predicting individual
server prices, which is akin to predicting the price of a
single stock. We argue that researchers should instead
focus on “index-based” modeling and prediction that aggregates prices from many markets in each region and
availability zone. We show that, for applications flexible enough to select and “trade” servers globally, making
decisions based on broader indices lowers costs and improves availability compared to index-agnostic policies.
