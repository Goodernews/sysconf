
Density estimation forms a critical component of many analytics
tasks including outlier detection, visualization, and statistical testing.
These tasks often seek to classify data into high and low-density
regions of a probability distribution. Kernel Density Estimation
(KDE) is a powerful technique for computing these densities, offer-
ing excellent statistical accuracy but quadratic total runtime. In this
paper, we introduce a simple technique for improving the perfor-
mance of using a KDE to classify points by their density (density
classification). Our technique, thresholded kernel density classi-
fication (tKDC), applies threshold-based pruning to spatial index
traversal to achieve asymptotic speedups over naïve KDE, while
maintaining accuracy guarantees. Instead of exactly computing each
point’s exact density for use in classification, tKDC iteratively com-
putes density bounds and short-circuits density computation as soon
as bounds are either higher or lower than the target classification
threshold. On a wide range of dataset sizes and dimensions, tKDC
demonstrates empirical speedups of up to 1000x over alternatives.
