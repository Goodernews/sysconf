processes to make data-driven decisions. However, there are
large inefficiencies in the enterprise-wide workflow that stem
from the fact that business workflows are expressed in natural language but the actual computational workflow has
to be manually translated into computational programs. In
this paper, we present an initial approach to bridge this gap
by targeting the data science component of enterprise workflows. In many cases, this component is the slowest part of
the overall enterprise process, and focusing on it allows us to
take an initial step in solving the larger enterprise-wide productivity problem. In this initial approach, we propose using
a chatbot to allow a data scientist to assemble data analytics
pipelines. A crucial insight is that while precise interpretation of general natural language continues to be challenging,
controlled natural language methods are starting to become
practical as natural interfaces in complex decision-making
domains. In addition, we recognize that data science workflow components are often templatized. Putting these two
insights together, we develop a practical system, called Ava,
that uses (controlled) natural language to program data science workflows. We have an initial proof-of-concept that
demonstrates the potential of our approach.
