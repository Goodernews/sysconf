
Detecting anomalous behaviors of cloud platforms is
one of critical tasks for cloud providers. Every anomalous behavior
potentially causes incidents, especially some unaware and/or
unknown issues, which severely harm their SLA (Service Level
Agreement). Existing solutions generally monitor cloud platform
at different layers and then detect anomalies based on rules or
learning algorithms on monitoring metrics. However, complexity
of nowadays cloud platforms, high dynamics of cloud workloads
and thousands of various types of metrics make anomalous
behavior detection more challenging to be applied in production,
especially in large scale cloud production environments. In this
paper, we present a practical cloud anomalous behavior detection
system called Driftinsight. It firstly analyzes multi-denominational
metrics of each component and identifies a set of representative
steady components based on the convergences of their states.
Then it generates a state model and a state transit model for each
steady cloud component. Finally, it detects behavior anomalies of
these steady components in near real-time and meanwhile evolve
behavior models on the fly. The evaluation results of this
approach in a commercial large-scale PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
cloud are demonstrated its capability and efficiency.
