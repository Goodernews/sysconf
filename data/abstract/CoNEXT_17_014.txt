
We present a smartphone-based application, called LocBLE, for enabling users to estimate the location of nearby Bluetooth low energy
(BLE) beacons. In contrast to existing BLE beacon-based proximity
applications that can only show coarse-grained (immediate, near,
and far) distance estimation, LocBLEâ€™s fine-grained estimation can
enhance human-environment interactions.
LocBLE has three salient features in estimating location from
BLE beacon signals. First, it is adaptive to dynamic signal propagation environments by learning the environmental changes directly
from the received signal strength (RSS). Second, it performs sensorfusion for location estimation by utilizing motion sensor data and
RSS readings from a smartphone. Finally, LocBLE improves location
tracking accuracy with novel on-line calibration on a set of beacons nearby. We have built a prototype of LocBLE on smartphones
and evaluated it on commodity proximity-enabled beacons. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LocBLE achieves an average
of 1.8m and 1.2m accuracies in locating indoor and outdoor BLE
beacons, respectively.
