
. This paper describes a dynamic framework for mapping the
threads of parallel applications to the computation cores of parallel systems. We propose a feedback-based mechanism where the performance
of each thread is collected and used to drive the reinforcement-learning
policy of assigning affinities of threads to CPU cores. The proposed
framework is flexible enough to address different optimization criteria,
such as maximum processing speed and minimum speed variance among
threads. We evaluate the framework on the Ant Colony optimization parallel benchmark from the heuristic optimization application domain, and
demonstrate that we can achieve an improvement of 12% in the execution time compared to the default operating system scheduling /mapping
of threads under varying availability of resources (e.g. when multiple
applications are running on the same system).
