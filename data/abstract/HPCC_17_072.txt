
Phase Change Memory (PCM) is considered as one
of the most popular candidates to replace flash memory in mobile
consumer systems. PCM has many superior performance characteristics, including non-volatility, byte-addressability, low access
latency and power consumption. However, it also suffers from
finite program counts like flash memory. Prior researches used
PCM as a black box, and implemented the wear leveling schemes
in device controller, which failed to utilize file attributes in host
side and result in poor efficiency of wear evenness. In this paper,
we propose a file aware wear leveling algorithm (called FAWL)
for PCM-based storage system in mobile consumer electronics.
FAWL is designed in the host side, which combines file attributes
and statistical information of PCM. It exploits rich attributes of
files to divide files into different categories and distribute them
in suitable pages to avoid extra swap overhead. In addition, by
utilizing an adjust management in FAWL, the wear imbalance
can be greatly mitigated. Experimental results show that FAWL
effectively improves the lifetime of PCM compared with existing
wear leveling algorithms, including random swapping, start-gap
and segment swapping.
