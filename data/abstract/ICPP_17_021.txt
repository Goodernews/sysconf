
To overcome scalability and performance issues for
process queries over a web-scale RDF data, various studies have
proposed RDF SPARQL query processing algorithm using
parallel processing manners. However, it is hard to resolve the
scalability and performance issues together because the
problem of communication overhead between nodes is closely
related to the data distribution for parallel processing. For
efficient RDF query parallel processing, it is essential to
distribute and process data evenly while reducing
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose RDF query
parallel processing algorithms with RDF data partitioning
technique to guarantee evenly distributed data over the cluster.
We also propose our in-memory RDF query processing system
as a form of Bulk Synchronization Parallel system to reduce
network overhead. Our empirical evaluation results show that
the proposed system outperforms a popular RDF-3X on LUBM
benchmark and UniProt queries from 2.20 to 43.08 times.
Especially, the effectiveness of the system improves significantly
when the SPARQL queries are complex with high input and
select.
