achieve GBit/s data rates over reasonable distances due to the high
path loss. As a consequence, it is important to precisely align the
antenna beams between sender and receiver. Even minor movement
or rotation of a device can result in beam misalignment and thus
a strong performance degradation. Existing work as well as standards such as IEEE 802.11ad tackle this issue by means of antenna
sector probing. This comes at the expense of a significant overhead,
which may significantly reduce the performance of millimeter-wave
communication, particularly in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we
present a mechanism that can track both movement and rotation of
60 GHz mobile devices with zero overhead. To this end, we transmit
part of the preamble of each packet using a multi-lobe beampattern.
Our approach does not require any additional control messages and
is backward compatible with 802.11ad. We implement our scheme
on a 60 GHz testbed using phased antenna arrays, and show that
we reduce the angle error to less than 5Â° in most cases. We also
perform simulations to validate our approach in a wide range of
scenarios, achieving up to 2x throughput gain.
