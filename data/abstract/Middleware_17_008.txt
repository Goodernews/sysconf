
Onboarding network functions onto current clouds requires laborintensive configuration of the virtual environment. Developers
need to dimension the resources available to each virtual machine
such as CPU and memory, define thresholds for scaling dynamically
and create configuration files that operators can use to execute the
network services. This process is time consuming and dependent on
the server architecture. As resources are managed on an individual
virtual machine basis, services cannot be orchestrated end to end
without significant expertise. In this paper, we argue that much of
the manual configuration needed for onboarding services onto a
cloud can be automated. Moreover, we can automatically generate abstractions that consider services end-to-end and enable their
holistic orchestration. We propose a framework that benchmarks
network services during the onboarding process and generates an
elastic model which relates workload mixes to resource requirements, identifies component dependencies and automates service
operation on heterogeneous stacks. We have evaluated our framework using a real-time communication service that handles multiple
classes of workloads. Results show that underprovisioning can be
eliminated for regular daily traffic, reducing resource provisioning time by at least 5X for the most stressing traffic surges, while
improving key performance indicators by at least 40%.
