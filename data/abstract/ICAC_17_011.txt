
Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized
by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures of which about
30 percent of patients remain medically intractable and may
undergo surgical intervention; despite the latter, some may
still fail to attain a seizure-free outcome. Functional changes
may precede structural ones in the epileptic brain and may
be detectable using existing noninvasive modalities. Functional
connectivity analysis through electroencephalography (EEG) and
resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-[MRD),
complemented by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has provided
such meaningful input in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
Recently, the emergence of edge computing has provided competent solutions enabling context-aware and real-time response
services for users. By leveraging the potential of autonomic edge
computing in epilepsy, we develop and deploy both noninvasive and invasive methods for the monitoring, evaluation and
regulation of the epileptic brain, with responsive neurostimulation (RNS; Neuropace). First, an autonomic edge computing
framework is proposed for processing of big data as part of
a decision support system for surgical candidacy. Second, an
optimized model for estimation of the epileptogenic network using
independently acquired EEG and rs-fMRI is presented. Third,
an unsupervised feature extraction model is developed based
on a convolutional deep learning structure for distinguishing
interictal epileptic discharge (IED) periods from nonIED periods
using electrographic signals from electrocorticography (ECoG).
Experimental and simulation results from actual patient data
validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
