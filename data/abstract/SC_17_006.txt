
Deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been successful in
solving a wide range of machine learning problems. Specialized
hardware accelerators have been proposed to accelerate the execution of DNN algorithms for high-performance and energy efficiency.
Recently, they have been deployed in datacenters (potentially for
business-critical or industrial applications) and safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars. Soft errors caused by high-energy
particles have been increasing in hardware systems, and these can
lead to catastrophic failures in DNN systems. Traditional methods
for building resilient systems, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy
(TMR), are agnostic of the DNN algorithm and the DNN acceleratorâ€™s architecture. Hence, these traditional resilience approaches
incur high overheads, which makes them challenging to deploy. In
this paper, we experimentally evaluate the resilience characteristics of DNN systems (i.e, DNN software running on specialized
accelerators). We find that the error resilience of a DNN system
depends on the data types, values, data reuses, and types of layers
in the design. Based on our observations, we propose two efficient
protection techniques for DNN systems.
