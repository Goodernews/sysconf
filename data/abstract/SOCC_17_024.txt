
Next-generation non-volatile memories (NVMs) will provide byte
addressability, persistence, high density, and DRAM-like performance. They have the potential to benefit many datacenter applications. However, most previous research on NVMs has focused on
using them in a single machine environment. It is still unclear how
to best utilize them in distributed, datacenter environments.

We introduce Distributed Shared Persistent Memory (DSPM), a
new framework for using persistent memories in distributed datacenter environments. DSPM provides a new abstraction that allows
applications to both perform traditional memory load and store
instructions and to name, share, and persist their data.

We built Hotpot, a kernel-level DSPM system that provides lowlatency, transparent memory accesses, data persistence, data reliability, and high availability. The key ideas of Hotpot are to integrate
distributed memory caching and data replication techniques and
to exploit application hints. We implemented Hotpot in the Linux
kernel and demonstrated its benefits by building a distributed graph
engine on Hotpot and porting a NoSQL database to Hotpot. Our
evaluation shows that Hotpot outperforms a recent distributed
shared memory system by 1.3x to 3.2x and a recent distributed
PM-based file system by 1.5x to 3.0x.
