
The problem of task scheduling with communication
delays is NP-hard. State-space search algorithms such as A*
have been shown to be a promising approach to solving this
problem optimally. A recently proposed state-space model for
task scheduling, known as Allocation-Ordering (AQ), allows
state-space search methods to be applied to the problem of
optimal task scheduling without the need for duplicate avoidance mechanisms. This paper examines the performance of two
parallel search algorithms when applied to both the AO model
and the older ELS state-space model. This suggests that its use
may provide an advantage with many different variations on
state-space search. This paper explores the application of AO
to some of these variants, namely depth-first branch-and-bound
(DFBnB) and parallel search. We also present an update to
the formulation of AO that prevents invalid states from being
considered during a search. An evaluation shows that AO gives
a clear advantage to DFBnB and allows greater scalability for
parallel search algorithms. The update to AOâ€™s formulation has
no significant impact on performance either way.
