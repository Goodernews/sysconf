they store. Our main goal is to understand query answering
under graph schema mappings — in particular, in exchange
and integration of graph data — for graph databases that
mix graph structure with data. We show that adding data
querying alters the picture in a significant way.

As the model, we use data graphs: a theoretical abstraction of property graphs employed by graph database implementations. We start by showing a very strong negative result: using the simplest form of nontrivial navigation in mappings makes answering even simple queries that mix navigation and data undecidable. This result suggests that for
the purposes of integration and exchange, schema mappings
ought to exclude recursively defined navigation over target
data. For such mappings and analogs of regular path queries
that take data into account, query answering becomes decidable, although intractable. To restore tractability without imposing further restrictions on queries, we propose a
new approach based on the use of null values that resemble
usual nulls of relational DBMSs, as opposed to marked nulls
one typically uses in integration and exchange tasks. If one
moves away from path queries and considers more complex
patterns, query answering becomes undecidable again, even
for the simplest possible mappings.
