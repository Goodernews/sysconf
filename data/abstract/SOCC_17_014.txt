become a daunting and time-consuming task: parameters may be
tuned from a space of hundreds or even thousands of possible configurations. In this paper, we present a framework for automating
parameter tuning for stream-processing systems. Our framework
supports standard black-box optimization algorithms as well as a
novel gray-box optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the multiple benefits of automated parameter tuning in optimizing three
benchmark applications in Apache Storm. Our results show that
a hill-climbing algorithm that uses a new heuristic sampling approach based on Latin Hypercube provides the best results. Our
gray-box algorithm provides comparable results while being two
to five times faster.
