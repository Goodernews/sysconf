
 Perpetual awareness systems are sensing systems characterized by continuous monitoring
and ubiquitous sensing; they are essential to many
safety and mission-critical applications, e.g. assisted
living, healthcare and public safety. In this paper,
we present SAFER, a perpetual heterogeneous IoT
system; deployed in homes to detect critical events
(injury, hazardous-environment) that must trigger
immediate action and response. A key challenge here
is the energy consumption associated with perpetual operations. We propose a novel energy-aware
perpetual home IoT system where battery-operated
and wall-powered IoT devices co-execute to ensure
safety of occupants. We use a semantic approach that
extracts activities-of-daily-living from device data to
drive energy-optimized sensor activations. To validate
our approach, we developed an elderly fall detection
system using multi-personal and in-situ sensing devices. Using initial measurements to drive larger simulations, we show that our Cost-Function-Gradient
algorithm can achieve greater than 4X reductions in
energy dissipation without loss of sensing accuracy.
