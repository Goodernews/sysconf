
Derivative clouds, light weight application containers provisioned
in virtual machines, are becoming viable and cost-effective options
for infrastructure and software-based services. Ubiquitous dynamic
memory management techniques in virtualized systems are centralized at the hypervisor and are ineffective in nested derivative
cloud setups. In this paper, we highlight the challenges in management of memory resources in derivative cloud systems. Hypervisor
caching, an enabler of centralized disk cache management, provides flexible memory or non-volatile memory management at the
hypervisor to improve the resource usage efficiency and performance of applications. Existing hypervisor caching solutions have
limited effectiveness in nested setups due to their nesting agnostic
design, centralized management model and lack of holistic view of
memory management. We propose DoubleDecker, a decentralized
disk caching framework, realized through guest OS and hypervisor
cooperation, with support for efficient memory management in derivative clouds. The DoubleDecker hypervisor caching framework,
an integral part of our proposed solution, provides interfaces for
differentiated cache partitioning and management in nested setups
and is equipped to handle both memory and SSD based caching
stores. We demonstrate the flexibility of DoubleDecker to handle
dynamic and changing memory provisioning requirements and
its capability to simultaneously provision memory across multiple levels. Such multi-level configurations cannot be explored by
centralized designs and are a key feature of DoubleDecker. Our
experimentation with DoubleDecker demonstrates that application
performance can be consistently improved due to the flexible policy
framework for disk caching. With our setup, we report an average
performance improvement of 4x and a maximum of 11x.
