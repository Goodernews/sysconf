scale systems makes the optimization of large scale scientific applications
particularly challenging. Efficiently leveraging these complex systems
requires a great deal of technical expertise and a considerable amount
of man-hours. The computational neuroscience community relies on an
handful of those frameworks to model the electrical activity of brain tissue at different scales. As the members of the Blue Brain Project actively
contribute to a large part of those frameworks, it becomes mandatory to
implement a strategy to reduce the overall development cost. Therefore,
we present Neuromapp, a computational neuroscience mini-application
framework. Neuromapp consists of a number of mini-apps (small standalone applications) that represent a single functionality in one of the
large scientific frameworks. The collection of several mini-apps forms a
skeleton which is able to reproduce the original workflow of the scientific
application. Thus, it becomes easy to investigate both single component and workflow optimizations, new software and hardware systems
or future system design. New solutions can then be integrated into the
large scientific applications if proved to be successful, reducing the overall
development and optimization effort.
