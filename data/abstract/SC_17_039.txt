
Parameter tuning is an important task of storage performance
optimization. Current practice usually involves numerous tweakbenchmark cycles that are slow and costly. To address this issue,
we developed CAPES, a model-less deep reinforcement learningbased unsupervised parameter tuning system driven by a deep
neural network (DNN). It is designed to find the optimal values
of tunable parameters in computer systems, from a simple clientserver system to a large data center, where human tuning can be
costly and often cannot achieve optimal performance. CAPES takes
periodic measurements of a target computer system’s state, and
trains a DNN which uses Q-learning to suggest changes to the
system’s current parameter values. CAPES is minimally intrusive,
and can be deployed into a production system to collect training
data and suggest tuning actions during the system’s daily operation.
Evaluation of a prototype on a Lustre file system demonstrates an
increase in I/O throughput up to 45% at saturation point.
