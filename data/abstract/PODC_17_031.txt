
The set agreement power of a shared object O describes O’s ability to
solve set agreement problems: it is the sequence (11, n2,...,%,--)

such that, for every k > 1, using O and registers one can solve the kset agreement problem among at most nx processes. It has been
shown that the ability of an object O to implement other objects
is not fully characterized by its consensus number (the first component of its set agreement power) [1, 3, 14]. This raises the following
natural question: is the ability of an object O to implement other
objects fully characterized by its set agreement power? We prove
that the answer is no: every level n > 2 of Herlihy’s consensus
hierarchy has two objects that have the same set agreement power
but are not equivalent, ie., at least one cannot implement the other.
We also show that every level n > 2 of the consensus hierarchy
contains a deterministic object On with some set agreement power
(11, N2,...,Mz,...) such that being able to solve the k-set agreement problems among n x processes, for all k > 1, is not enough to
implement On.
