
 Energy efficiency is considered a challenging
problem in modern multicore systems. Partitioning the cores into
multiple voltage and frequency islands (VFI) provides a
compromise between simple global Dynamic Voltage Frequency
Scaling (DVFS) and fine-grain per-core, per-task DVFS. This
paper formulates the optimization problem of scheduling tasks
statically on multiple VFIs as a Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) such that for a given energy budget, the
program execution time (makespan) is minimized. Our proposed
solution consists of two steps. In the first step, we use an Integer
Linear Programming (ILP)-based algorithm, from our previous
work, to assign per-core fine-grain dynamic Voltage/Frequency
(V/F) levels to each task in a task set (program) to minimize the
makespan for a given energy budget. In the second step, which is
the focus of this paper, we use the MILP framework to schedule
this task set, with the given V/F levels provided in step one, on the
islands of a VFI-enabled multicore system to again minimize the
makespan subject to (1) the energy budget and (2) the task setâ€™s
precedence (dependency) constraints. Together with the solutions
obtained by MILP, a round-robin algorithm is used to compare
these two methodologies to [LP that provides the best solution.
Our experimental results show that across all the benchmarks
considered, the MILP-based and round-robin makespan
solutions are on average 1.2 and 2.28 times slower than the ILPbased makespan solutions, respectively.
