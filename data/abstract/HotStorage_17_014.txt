the partial-stripe writes in SSD RAIDs, we propose two
schemes: parity-stream separation and SLC/MLC convertible programming. Parity-stream separation splits
the parity block stream from the data block stream to
decrease valid page copy during garbage collection. In
the convertible programming scheme, the flash memory
blocks that are allocated for parity data are programmed
in SLC mode to reduce the wear caused by programming
stress, while the other flash memory blocks are written in
MLC mode as usual. Evaluation shows that our scheme
decreased garbage collection overhead by up to 58% and
improved lifespan by up to 54%, assuming that the MLC
write stress was 3.5 times that of the SLC.
