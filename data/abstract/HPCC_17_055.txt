most common ways of information leakage Software-Defined
Networking is facing, which brings a serious threat to cyber
security. However, the existing defense technologies mainly focus
on how to detect attacks and reduce the attack success rate. The
paper proposes a method from another perspective to minimize
the cost that the network undertakes and find an optimal
defenderâ€™s strategy when an attack is unavoidable in some case.
The main work is as follows. First of all, we models the scenario
of attack and defense as a Stackelberg Games, and prove the
optimal strategy is equal to the SSE (Strong Stackelberg
Equilibrium). Furthermore, we design an algorithm to solve the
equilibrium of the game in the case of infinite strategic space.
Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm is feasible, and then the optimal defense strategy we
obtained is significantly superior to other general strategies and
cut down the total cost of the whole network in practical.
