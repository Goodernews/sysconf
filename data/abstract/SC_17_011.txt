
Recently, various applications including data analytics and machine
learning have been developed for geo-distributed cloud data centers. For those applications, the ways to map parallel processes
to physical nodes (i.e., “process mapping”) could significantly impact the performance of the applications because of non-uniform
communication cost in such geo-distributed environments. While
process mapping has been widely studied in grid/cluster environments, few of the existing studies have considered the problem in
geo-distributed cloud environments. In this paper, we propose a
novel model to formulate the geo-distributed process mapping problem and develop a new method to efficiently find the near optimal
solution. Our algorithm considers both the network communication
performance of geo-distributed data centers as well as the communication matrix of the target application. Evaluation results with real
experiments on Amazon EC2 and simulations demonstrate that our
proposal achieves significant performance improvement (50% on
average) compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
