
Trustworthy operation of industrial control systems
(ICS) depends on secure code execution on the embedded programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The controllers monitor and
control the underlying physical plants such as electric power
grids and continuously report back the system status to human
operators.

We present HARVEY, ! a PLC rootkit that implements a
physics-aware stealthy attack against cyberphysical power grid
control systems. HARVEY sits within the PLC’s firmware below
the control logic and modifies control commands before they are
sent out by the PLC’s output modules to the physical plant’s
actuators. HARVEY replaces legitimate control commands with
malicious, adversary-optimal commands to maximize the damage
to the physical power equipment and cause large-scale failures. To
ensure system safety, the operators observe the status of the power
system by fetching system parameter values from PLC devices.
To conceal the maliciously caused anomalous behavior from
operators, HARVEY intercepts the sensor measurement inputs to
the PLC device. HARVEY simulates the power system with the legitimate control commands (which were intercepted/replaced with
malicious ones), and calculates/injects the sensor measurements
that operators would expect to see. We implemented HARVEY
on the widely spread Allen Bradley PLC and evaluated it on a
real-world electric power grid test-bed. The results empirically
prove HARVEY’s deployment feasibility in practice nowadays.
