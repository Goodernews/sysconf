
Hines matrices arise in the simulations of mathematical models describing initiation and propagation of action
potentials in a neuron. In this work, we exploit the structural
properties of Hines matrices and design a scalable, linear work,
recursive parallel algorithm for solving a system of linear
equations where the underlying matrix is a Hines matrix, using
the Exact Domain Decomposition Method (EDD). We give a
general form for representing a Hines matrix and use the general
form to prove that the intermediate matrix obtained via the EDD
has the same structural properties as that of a Hines matrix.

Using the above observation, we propose a novel decomposition
strategy called fine decomposition which is suitable for a GPU
architecture. Our algorithmic approach R-FINE-TPT based on
fine decomposition outperforms the previously known approach
in all the cases and gives a speedup of 2.5x on average for a variety
of input neuron morphologies. We further perform experiments
to understand the behaviour of R-FINE-TPT approach and show
its robustness. We also employ a machine learning technique
called linear regression to effectively guide recursion in our
algorithm.
