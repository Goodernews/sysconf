shared memory and L1 cache to efficiently service a large
number of concurrent memory requests (to contiguous memory
space). To support warp-wide accesses to L1 cache, GPU L1
cache lines are very wide. However, such L1 cache architecture
cannot always be efficiently utilized when applications generate
many memory requests with irregular access patterns especially due to branch and memory divergences. In this paper,
we propose Elastic-Cache that can efficiently support
both fine- and coarse-grained L1 cache-line management for
applications with both regular and irregular memory access
patterns. Specifically, it can store 32- or 64-byte words in
non-contiguous memory space to a single 128-byte cache line.
Furthermore, it neither requires an extra tag storage structure
nor reduces the capacity of L1 cache since it stores auxiliary
tags for fine-grained L1 cache-line managements in sharedmemory space that is not fully used in many applications.
Our experiment shows that Elastic-Cache improves the
geo-mean performance of applications with irregular memory
access patterns by 58% without degrading performance of
applications with regular memory access patterns.
