control plane actions performed by switches. For example, traffic
engineering techniques that frequently reconfigure the network
require guarantees on the speed of reconfiguring the network. Initial experiments show that poor performance of Ternary ContentAddressable Memory (TCAM) control actions (e.g., rule insertion)
can inflate application performance by a factor of 2x! Yet, modern
switches provide no guarantees for these important control plane
actions â€” inserting, modifying, or deleting rules.

In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of Hermes,
a practical and immediately deployable framework that offers a
novel method for partitioning and optimizing switch TCAM to
enable performance guarantees. Hermes builds on recent studies
on switch performance and provides guarantees by trading-off a
nominal amount of TCAM space for assured performance. We evaluated Hermes using large-scale simulations. Our evaluations show
that with less than 5% overheads, Hermes provides 5ms insertion
guarantees that translates into an improvement of application level
metrics by up to 80%. Hermes is more than 50% better than existing
state of the art techniques and provides significant improvement
for traditional networks running BGP.
