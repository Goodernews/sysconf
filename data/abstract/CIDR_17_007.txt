
The rigid schemas of classical relational databases help users
in specifying queries and inform the storage organization of
data. However, the advantages of schemas come at a high
upfront cost through schema and ETL process design. In
this work, we propose a new paradigm where the database
system takes a more active role in schema development and
data integration. We refer to this approach as adaptive
schema databases (ASDs). An ASD ingests semi-structured
or unstructured data directly using a pluggable combination of extraction and data integration techniques. Over
time it discovers and adapts schemas for the ingested data
using information provided by data integration and information extraction techniques, as well as from queries and
user-feedback. In contrast to relational databases, ASDs
maintain multiple schema workspaces that represent individualized views over the data, which are fine-tuned to the
needs of a particular user or group of users. A novel aspect of ASDs is that probabilistic database techniques are
used to encode ambiguity in automatically generated data
extraction workflows and in generated schemas. ASDs can
provide users with context-dependent feedback on the quality of a schema, both in terms of its ability to satisfy a userâ€™s
queries, and the quality of the resulting answers. We outline
our vision for ASDs, and present a proof of concept implementation as part of the Mimir probabilistic data curation
system.
