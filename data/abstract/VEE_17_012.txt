offer hypervisor-based reliability and security monitors for
cloud virtual machines. Cloud VMs can be heterogeneous
and as such guest OS parameters needed for monitoring
can vary across different VMs and must be obtained in
some way. Past work involves running code inside the VM,
which is unacceptable for a cloud environment. We solve this
problem by recognizing that there are common OS design
patterns that can be used to infer monitoring parameters from
the guest OS. We extract information about the cloud user’s
guest OS with the user’s existing VM image and knowledge
of OS design patterns as the only inputs to analysis. To
demonstrate the range of monitoring functionality possible
with this technique, we implemented four sample monitors:
a guest OS process tracer, an OS hang detector, a return-touser attack detector, and a process-based keylogger detector.
