
How to preserve users’ privacy while supporting high-utility
analytics for low-latency stream processing?

To answer this question: we describe the design,
implementation and evaluation of PRIVAPPROX, a data
analytics system for privacy-preserving stream processing.
PRIVAPPROX provides three important properties: (i)
Privacy: zero-knowledge privacy guarantee for users, a
privacy bound tighter than the state-of-the-art differential
privacy; (ii) Utility: an interface for data analysts to
systematically explore the trade-offs between the output
accuracy (with error estimation) and the query execution
budget; (iii) Latency: near real-time stream processing based
on a scalable “synchronization-free” distributed architecture.

The key idea behind our approach is to marry two techniques together, namely, sampling (used for approximate
computation) and randomized response (used for privacypreserving analytics). The resulting marriage is complementary — it achieves stronger privacy guarantees, and also
improves the performance for stream analytics.
