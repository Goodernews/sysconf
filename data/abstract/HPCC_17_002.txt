
Projecting a high-dimensional dataset onto a lower
dimensional space can improve the efficiency of knowledge
discovery and facilitate real-time data analysis. One technique
for dimension reduction, weighted multi-dimensional scaling
(WMDS), approximately preserves pairwise weighted distances
during the transformation; but its O(f(n)d) algorithm impedes
real-time performance on large datasets.

Thus, we present CLARET, our fast and portable parallel
WMDS tool that combines algorithmic concepts adapted and
extended from the stochastic force-based MDS (SF-MDS)
and Glimmer. To further improve CLARET’s performance
for real-time data analysis, we propose a preprocessing step
that computes approximate weighted Euclidean distances by
combining a novel data mapping called stretching and Johnson
Lindestrauss’ lemma in O(log d) time in place of the original
O(d) time. This preprocessing step reduces the complexity of
WMDS from O(f(n)d) to O( f (n) log d), which for large d is a
significant computational gain. Finally, we present a case study
of CLARET by integrating it into an interactive visualization
tool called V2PI to facilitate real-time analytics. To ensure
the quality of the projections, we propose a geometric shape
matching-based alignment process and a quality metric.
