
As servers are equipped with more memory modules
each with larger capacity, main-memory systems are now the
second highest energy-consuming component in big-memory
servers and their energy consumption even becomes comparable
to processors in some servers. Meanwhile, it is critical for bigmemory servers and their main-memory systems to offer high
energy efficiency. Prior work exploited mobile LPDDR devicesâ€™
advantages (lower power than DDR devices) while attempting
to surmount their limitations (onger latency, lower bandwidth,
or both). However, we demonstrate that such main memory
architectures (based on the latest LPDDR4 devices) are no longer
effective. This is because the power consumption of present DDR4
devices has substantially decreased by adopting the strength of
mobile and graphics memory whereas LPDDR4 has sacrificed
energy efficiency and focused more on increasing data transfer
rates; we also exhibit that the power consumption of DDR4
devices can substantially vary across manufacturers. Moreover,
investigating a new energy-saving feature of DDR4 devices in
depth, we show that activating this feature often hurts overall
energy efficiency of servers due to its performance penalties.
