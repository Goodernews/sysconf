end, we collected 2.14@ DNSSEC keys for popular
signed domains out of these 1.9M are RSA keys. We
analyse the RSA keys and show that a large fraction
of signed domains are using vulnerable keys: 35% are
signed with RSA keys that share their moduli with some
other domain and 66% use keys that are too short (1024
bit or less) or keys which modulus has a GCD > 1 with
the modulus of some other domain. As we show, to a
large extent the vulnerabilities are due to poor key generation practices, but also due to potential faulty hardware
or software bugs.

The DNSSEC keys collection and analysis is performed on a daily basis with the DNSSEC Keys Validation Engine which we developed. The statistics as well as
the DNSSEC Keys Validation Engine are made available
online, as a service for Internet users.
