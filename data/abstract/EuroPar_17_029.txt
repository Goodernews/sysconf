
. We propose a technique called speculative lagging, which
improves performance by dynamically adding periods of idle execution
into the message-oriented system. The speculation is guided by a statistical model, which predicts context switches that benefit from delays. We
analytically derive the expected speedup, which, for a fixed confidence,
allows identifying lagging opportunities in O(1) time, without a performance overhead. We describe the corresponding speculation algorithm
and use it to extend an existing scheduler. Comparison with other actor
frameworks on standard benchmarks shows improvements of up to 2.1x.
