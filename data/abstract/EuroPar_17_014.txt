However exploring data layouts is time-consuming and errorprone, and assessing the impact of a layout transformation on performance is difficult without performing it. We propose to guide application programmers through data layout restructuring by providing a
comprehensive multidimensional description of the initial layout, built
from trace analysis, and then by giving a performance evaluation of the
transformations tested and an expression of each transformed layout.
The programmer can limit the exploration to layouts matching some
patterns. We apply this method to two multithreaded applications. The
performance prediction of multiple transformations matches within 5%
the performance of hand-transformed layout code.
