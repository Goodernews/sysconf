
. We propose PASCAL, a parallel unified algorithmic framework for generalized N-body problems. PASCAL utilizes tree data
structures and user-controlled pruning or approximations to reduce the
asymptotic runtime complexity from being linear in the number of data
points to be logarithmic. In PASCAL, the domain scientists express
their N-body problem in terms of application-specific operations, and
PASCAL generates the pruning and approximation conditions automatically from this high-level specification. In order to evaluate PASCAL,
we generate solutions for six problems: k-nearest neighbors, range search,
Euclidean minimum spanning tree, kernel density estimation, expectation maximization (EM), and Hausdorff distance chosen from various
domains.

We show that applying domain-specific optimizations and parallelizations to the algorithms generated by PASCAL achieves 10x to 230x
speedup compared to state-of-the-art libraries on a dual-socket Intel
Xeon processor with 16 cores on real world datasets. We also obtain
a novel out-of-the-box asymptotically optimal algorithm for Hausdorff
distance calculation and an improved algorithm for EM. This shows the
impact and potential of PASCAL in rapidly extending to a larger class
of problems that are yet to be explored.
