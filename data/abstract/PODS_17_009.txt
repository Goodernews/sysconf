these tasks, and in addition a number of prototype systems have
been developed. While individual chase-based systems and particular optimizations of the chase have been experimentally evaluated
in the past, we provide the first comprehensive and publicly available benchmark—test infrastructure and a set of test scenarios—for
evaluating chase implementations across a wide range of assumptions about the dependencies and the data. We used our benchmark
to compare chase-based systems on data exchange and query answering tasks with one another, as well as with systems that can
solve similar tasks developed in closely related communities. Our
evaluation provided us with a number of new insights concerning
the factors that impact the performance of chase implementations.
