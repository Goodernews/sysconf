
In this paper we propose DRAFTS — a methodology for implementing probabilistic guarantees of instance reliability in the Amazon
Spot tier. Amazon offers “unreliable” virtual machine instances
(ones that may be terminated at any time) at a potentially large discount relative to “reliable” On-demand and Reserved instances. Our
method predicts the “bid values” that users can specify to provision
Spot instances which ensure at least a fixed duration of execution
with a given probability. We illustrate the method and test its validity using Spot pricing data post facto, both randomly and using
real-world workload traces. We also test the efficacy of the method
experimentally by using it to launch Spot instances and then observing the instance termination rate. Our results indicate that it
is possible to obtain the same level of reliability from unreliable
instances that the Amazon service level agreement guarantees for
reliable instances with a greatly reduced cost.
