
MapReduce is a framework for processing large
data sets much used in the context of cloud computing. MapReduce implementations like Hadoop can tolerate crashes and
file corruptions, but not arbitrary faults. Unfortunately, there
is evidence that arbitrary faults do occur and can affect the
correctness of MapReduce job executions. Furthermore, many
outages of major cloud offerings have been reported, raising
concerns about the dependence on a single cloud.

In this paper we propose a novel execution system that allows
to scale out MapReduce computations to a cloud-of-clouds and
tolerate arbitrary faults, malicious faults, and cloud outages. Our
system, Chrysaor, is based on a fine-grained replication scheme
that tolerates faults at the task level. Our solution has three
important properties: it tolerates the above-mentioned classes of
faults at reasonable cost; it requires minimal modifications to
the usersâ€™ applications; and it does not involve changes to the
Hadoop source code. We performed an extensive evaluation of our
system in Amazon EC2, showing that our fine-grained solution is
efficient in terms of computation by recovering only faulty tasks.
This is achieved without incurring a significant penalty for the
baseline case (i.e., without faults) in most workloads.
