
Due to the increasing popularity of smartphones,
many people are now equipped with both a smartphone and
at least one desktop (or laptop) computer. Although the two
computing devices are used for similar purposes (e.g., email, web
browsing), they are often both kept on for the userâ€™s convenience,
despite only one device is actively used at a time. Therefore, if
one of the two computing devices can be put into an energysaving mode when the other one is in use, a significant amount
of energy can be saved for both the phone and the desktop.

In this paper, we propose CoSmart, a light-weight solution
that coordinates the smartphone with the desktop for joint
energy savings. CoSmart dynamically degrades the smartphone
to a feature phone with only basic GSM functions when the
user is detected to be with the desktop, in order to save both
computation and idle energy. The desktop is then put into sleep
for energy savings when the user leaves it, while the phone can
be turned back to a smartphone, such that the user can continue
the operation with seamless task migration. There are several
research challenges in the design of CoSmart, which include 1)
predicting whether the user would stay long enough with the
desktop to offset the migration overheads, and 2) determining
the best time point for task migration that can result in the
most energy savings. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm
for dynamic idle time length prediction, and model joint energy
savings as an optimization problem for the most energy savings. A
prototype of CoSmart is implemented in Android and evaluated
using different real user traces and popular apps. Results show
CoSmart can achieve, on average, 61.3% energy savings for the
smartphone and 46.7% energy savings for the desktop, which
outperforms other baselines by as much as 17.2% to 19.0%.
