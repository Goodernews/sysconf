and the MIT Sanctum processor, offer compelling security features
but lack formal guarantees. We introduce a verification methodology based on a trusted abstract platform (TAP), a formalization
of idealized enclave platforms along with a parameterized adversary. We also formalize the notion of secure remote execution and
present machine-checked proofs showing that the TAP satisfies the
three key security properties that entail secure remote execution:
integrity, confidentiality and secure measurement. We then present
machine-checked proofs showing that SGX and Sanctum are refinements of the TAP under certain parameterizations of the adversary,
demonstrating that these systems implement secure enclaves for
the stated adversary models.
