
Mobile edge cloud has been increasingly concerned
by researchers due to its closer distance to mobile users than
the traditional cloud on Internet. Offloading computations from
mobile devices to the nearby edge cloud is an effective technique
to accelerate the applications and/or save energy on the mobile
devices. However, the mobile edge cloud usually has limited
computation resources and constrained access bandwidth shared
by multiple users in its proximity. Thus, allocation of resources
and bandwidth among the users is significant to the overall
application performance. In this paper, we study network aware
multi-user computation partitioning problem in mobile edge clouds,
i.e., to decide for each user which parts of the application should
be offload onto the edge cloud, and which others should be
executed locally, and meanwhile to allocate the access bandwidth
among the users, such that the average application performance
of the users is maximized.

This problem is novel in that we consider the competition
among users for both computing resources and bandwidth, and
jointly optimizes the partitioning decisions with the allocation
of resources and bandwidths among users, while most existing
works either focus on the single user computation partitioning
or study the multiple user computation partitioning without
regard of the constrained network bandwidth. We first formulate
the problem, and then transform it into the classic Multi-class
Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem and develop an effective
algorithm, namely Performance Function Matrix based Heuristic
(PFM-H), to solve it. Comprehensive simulations show that
our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms
significantly in the average application performance.
