acterized by intermittent connectivity and asynchronous send
ing/reception of data. To create effective mobile systems
for such environments, it is essential to guarantee acceptable levels of timeliness between sending and receiving mobile users. In order to provide QoS guarantees in different application scenarios and contexts, it is necessary to
model the system performance by incorporating the intermittent connectivity. Queueing Network Models (QNMs)
offer a simple modeling environment, which can be used to
represent various application scenarios, and provide accurate analytical solutions for performance metrics, such as
system response time. In this paper, we provide an analytical solution regarding the end-to-end response time between
users sending and receiving data by modeling the intermittent connectivity of mobile users with QNMs. We utilize
the publish /subscribe (pub/sub) middleware as the underlying communication infrastructure for mobile users. To represent the userâ€™s connections/disconnections, we model and
solve analytically an ON/OFF queueing system by applying
a mean value approach. Finally, we validate our model using
simulations with real-world workload traces. The deviations
between the performance results foreseen by the analytical
model and the ones provided by the simulator are shown to
be less than 5% for a variety of scenarios.
