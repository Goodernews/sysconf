avoid the I/O bottleneck in disk-based checkpointing for
tolerating a small number of node failures in large distributed
systems. However, the existing encoding schemes used by diskless
checkpointing lead to high communication overheads because of
cross node encoding. This negates the advantages of diskless
checkpointing, especially in scenarios with a limited network
bandwidth. This paper proposes a diskless checkpointing scheme
with vertical encoding to address this problem. Vertical encoding
eliminates the dependency among nodes and also facilitates a
balanced communication. Moreover, an analysis model is
developed to obtain an optimal configuration parameter.
Experimental results show that the proposed scheme reduces
significantly the communication overhead of both checkpointing
and fault recovery, with no encoding overhead introduced.
