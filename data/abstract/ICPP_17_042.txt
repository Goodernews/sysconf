
In this paper we consider the data caching problem
in next generation data services in the cloud, which is characterized by using monetary cost and access trajectory information
to control cache replacements, instead of exploiting capacityoriented strategies as in traditional research. In particular, given
a stream of requests to a shared data item with respect to
a homogeneous cost model, we first propose a fast off-line
algorithm using dynamic programming techniques. The proposed
algorithm can generate optimal schedule within O(mn) timespace complexity to cache, migrate as well as replicate the
shared data item to serve an n-length request sequence with
minimum cost in a fully connected m-node network, substantially
improving the previous results. Additionally, we also study this
problem in its online form, and present a 3-competitive online
algorithm by leveraging a speculative caching idea. The algorithm
can serve an online request in constant time, and is space efficient
in O(m) as well, rendering it to be more practical in reality.
Our research complements the shortage of similar research in
literature on this problem.
