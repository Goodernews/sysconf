that can achieve good plan quality across multiple instances
of a parameterized query. An ideal solution to PQO would
process query instances online and ensure (a) tight, bounded
cost sub-optimality for each instance, (b) low optimization
overheads, and (c) only a small number of plans need to be
stored. Existing solutions to online PQO however, fall short
on at least one of the above metrics. We propose a plan recosting based approach that enables us to perform well on
all three metrics. We empirically show the effectiveness of
our technique on industry benchmark and real-world query
workloads with our modified version of the Microsoft SQL
Server query optimizer.
