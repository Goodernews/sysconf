placed at fixed locations with fixed capacity. Such nature makes
them difficult to protect todayâ€™s prevailing virtualized environments. Two emerging networking paradigms, Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN),
offer the potential to address these limitations. NFV envisions
to implement firewall function as software instance (a.k.a virtual
firewall). Virtual firewalls provide great flexibility and elasticity,
which are necessary to protect virtualized environments. In
this paper, we propose to build an innovative virtual firewall
controller, VFW Controller, to enable safe, efficient and costeffective virtual firewall elasticity control. VFW Controller
addresses four key challenges with respect to semantic consistency,
correct flow update, buffer overflow avoidance, and optimal scaling
in virtual firewall scaling. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement the core components of VFW Controller
on top of NFV and SDN environments. Our experimental results
demonstrate that VFW Controller is efficient to provide safe
elasticity control of virtual firewalls.
