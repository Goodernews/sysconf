
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is rapidly becoming the de facto
standard for access to all computing, whether via web, phone, or
direct command-line access. HPC centers and other institutions
supporting hundreds or thousands of users face challenging cost,
licensing, user support, and infrastructure deployment decisions
when considering a transition to MFA at scale.

This paper describes our experiences and lessons learned throughout the assessment, planning, and phased deployment of MFA across
production systems supporting more than 10,000 accounts. It focuses on the ultimate curation, creation, and integration of a multitude of software components, some developed in-house and built to
be compatible within existing HPC environments, and all of which
are freely available for open source distribution. We motivate the
development of this customized infrastructure by highlighting some
of the particular needs of our research community. What follows
is an information resource for others when considering their own
MFA deployments.
