benefit of both drivers and riders. Different from existing studies in ridesharing that focus on minimizing the travel costs of vehicles, we consider that the satisfaction of riders (the utility values) is more important nowadays. Thus, we formulate the problem of utility-aware ridesharing on road networks (URR) with the
goal of providing the optimal rider schedules for vehicles to maximize the overall utility, subject to spatial-temporal and capacity
constraints. To assign a new rider to a given vehicle, we propose
an efficient algorithm with a minimum increase in travel cost without reordering the existing schedule of the vehicle. We prove that
the URR problem is NP-hard by reducing it from the 0-1 Knapsack
problem and it is unlikely to be approximated within any constant
factor in polynomial time through a reduction from the DENS kSUBGRAPH problem. Therefore, we propose three efficient approximate algorithms, including a bilateral arrangement algorithm,
an efficient greedy algorithm and a grouping-based scheduling algorithm, to assign riders to suitable vehicles with a high overall
utility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our URR approaches on both real and
synthetic data sets.
