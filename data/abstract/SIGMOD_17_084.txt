social influence analysis has attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade. The diffusion process
is often modeled using influence graphs, and there has been
a line of research that involves algorithmic problems in influence graphs. However, the vast size of todayâ€™s real-world
networks raises a serious issue with regard to computational
efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for reducing
influence graphs. Given an input influence graph, the proposed algorithm produces a vertex-weighted influence graph,
which is compact and approximates the diffusion properties of the input graph. The central strategy of influence
graph reduction is coarsening, which has the potential to
greatly reduce the number of edges by merging a vertex
set into a single weighted vertex. We provide two implementations; a speed-oriented implementation which runs in
linear time with linear space and a scalability-oriented implementation which runs in practically linear time with sublinear space. Further, we present general frameworks using
our compact graphs that accelerate existing algorithms for
influence maximization and influence estimation problems,
which are motivated by practical applications, such as viral
marketing. Using these frameworks, we can quickly obtain
solutions that have accuracy guarantees under a reasonable
assumption. Experiments with real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can scale to billion-edge
graphs and reduce the graph size to up to 4%. In addition,
our influence maximization framework achieves four times
speed-up of a state-of-the-art D-SSA algorithm, and our influence estimation framework cuts down the computation
time of a simulation-based method to 3.5%.
