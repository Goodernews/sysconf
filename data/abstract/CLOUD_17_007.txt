
 The increasing relevance of information assurance
in cloud computing has forced governments and stakeholders to
turn their attention to Information Technology (IT) security
certifications and standards. The introduction of new frameworks
such as FedRAMP in the US and C5 in Germany is aimed to raise
the level of protection against threats and vulnerabilities unique to
cloud computing. However, our in-depth and systematic analyses
reveals that these new standards do not bring a radical change in
the realm of certifications. Results also shows that the newly
developed standards share much of their basis with older, more
consolidated standards such as the ISO/IEC 27001 and hence the
need for determining the added value.

In this study, we provide an overview of ISO/IEC 27001, C5,
and FedRAMP while examining their completeness and adequacy
in addressing current threats to cloud assurance. We question the
level of protection they offer by comparing these three
certifications alongside each other. We identify weaknesses in the
three frameworks and highlight necessary improvements to meet
the security requirements indispensable in relation to the current
threat landscape.
