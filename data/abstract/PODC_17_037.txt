and are subject to a fairness condition that guarantees eventual
progress, but generally have no internal mechanism for detecting
when this progress has occurred. We define an extension to the
standard population protocol that provides each agent with a clock
signal that indicates when the agent has waited long enough. To
simplify the model, we represent “long enough” as an infinite time
interval, and treat a clocked population protocol as operating over
transfinite time. This gives a clean theoretical model that we show
how to translate back into finite real-world executions where the
clock ticks whenever the underlying protocol is looping or stuck.

Over finite time intervals, the protocol behaves as in the standard
model. At nonzero limit ordinals w, w-2, etc., corresponding to clock
ticks, the protocol switches to a limit of previous configurations
supplemented by an signal registering in an extra component in
some of the agents’ states. Using transfinite times means that we can
represent fairness over sequences of transitions that may include
clock ticks with the same definition as over smaller intervals. Using
arbitrary ordinals allows using times like w* or w? to represent
convergence that depends on detecting convergence repeatedly at
lower levels.

We show that a clocked population protocol running in less than
co* time for any fixed k > 2 is equivalent in power to a nondeterministic Turing machine with space complexity logarithmic in the
size of the population. A consequence of this equivalence is that
any symmetric predicate that can be computed in less than w* time
can be computed in less than w” time, which requires only finitely
many clock ticks.
