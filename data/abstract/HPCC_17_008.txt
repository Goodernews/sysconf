
 â€” The methodology of system design of modern
intelligent control systems in the electric power industry and
their features are considered when providing the required
comfort in multi-zone buildings with the use of multi-agent
power consumption and comfort management systems. Such a
control system covers all the monitored zones of a building and, if
necessary, allows providing the greatest possible overall comfort
in the building while reducing the required electric power.

The purpose of this study is to develop a comfort
management system in a multi-zoned building that can provide
the greatest possible comfort while reducing the required electric
power.
