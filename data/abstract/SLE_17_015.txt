
We present FLowSrec, a declarative specification language
for the domain of dataflow analysis. FLowSpec has declarative support for the specification of control flow graphs
of programming languages, and dataflow analyses on these
control flow graphs. We define the formal semantics of
FLtowSpec, which is rooted in Monotone Frameworks. We
also discuss implementation techniques for the language,
partly used in the prototype implementation built in the
Spoorax Language Workbench. Finally, we evaluate the expressiveness and conciseness of the language with two case
studies. These case studies are analyses for GREEN-MARL, an
industrial, domain-specific language for graph processing.
The first case study is a classical dataflow analysis, scaled to
this full language. The second case study is a domain-specific
analysis of GREEN-MARL.
