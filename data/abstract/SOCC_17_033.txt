VM types and the choice of VM can have significant implications
on performance and cost. In this paper we address the fundamental
problem of accurately and economically choosing the best VM for
a given workload and user goals. To address the problem of optimal VM selection, we present PARIS, a data-driven system that
uses a novel hybrid offline and online data collection and modeling
framework to provide accurate performance estimates with minimal data collection. PARIS is able to predict workload performance
for different user-specified metrics, and resulting costs for a wide
range of VM types and workloads across multiple cloud providers.
When compared to sophisticated baselines, including collaborative
filtering and a linear interpolation model using measured workload
performance on two VM types, PARIS produces significantly better
estimates of performance. For instance, it reduces runtime prediction error by a factor of 4 for some workloads on both AWS and
Azure. The increased accuracy translates into a 45% reduction in
user cost while maintaining performance.
