
We reveal loopholes of Speculative Execution (SE) implementations
under a unique fault model: node-level network throughput degradation. This problem appears in many data-parallel frameworks
such as Hadoop MapReduce and Spark. To address this, we present
PBSE, a robust, path-based speculative execution that employs three
key ingredients: path progress, path diversity, and path-straggler
detection and speculation. We show how PBSE is superior to other
approaches such as cloning and aggressive speculation under the
aforementioned fault model. PBSE is a general solution, applicable
to many data-parallel frameworks such as Hadoop/HDFS+QF%S,
Spark and Flume.
