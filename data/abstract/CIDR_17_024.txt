
Have you ever been in a sauna? If yes, according to our recent survey
conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, people who go to saunas
are more likely to know that Mike Stonebraker is not a character in
“The Simpsons”. While this result clearly makes no sense, recently
proposed tools to automatically suggest visualizations, correlations,
or perform visual data exploration, significantly increase the chance
that a user makes a false discovery like this one. In this paper, we
first show how current tools mislead users to consider random fluctuations as significant discoveries. We then describe our vision and
early results for QUDE, a new system for automatically controlling
the various risk factors during the data exploration process.
