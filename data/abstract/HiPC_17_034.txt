
Hybrid multicore processors (HMPs) are poised to
dominate the landscape of the next generation of computing on
the desktop as well as on exascale systems. HMPs consist of
general purpose CPU cores along with specialized co-processors
and can provide high performance for a wide spectrum of
applications at significantly lower energy requirements per FLOP.

In this paper, we develop parallel algorithms and software
for constructing multi-resolution SAR images on HMPs. We
develop several load balancing algorithms for optimizing time
performance and energy on HMPs. We also present a systematic
approach for deriving the energy-time performance trade-offs on
HMPs in the presence of Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling.
Pareto-optimal curves are presented on a system consisting of 24
traditional cores and a GPU.
