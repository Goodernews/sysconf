phone time accessing web information, which could cause undesirably large energy drain. To provide web information, a web
activity may invoke asynchronous execution in different hardware
devices. Thus, traditional energy estimation methods based on
system statistics are usually insufficient to capture the secluded
energy cost. In this paper, we propose REEWA, a runtime energy
estimation framework for web activities on smartphones. In sharp
contrast to the traditional modeling methods, REEWA features
a design to provide highly accurate and low-overhead energy
estimation based on hardware performance counters that can
accurately record hardware-level events. Specifically, REEWA
features (1) a set of energy models for smartphone hardware
components involved in web activities, which are built based on
their respective performance counters; (2) a correlation study
on the counter selection process that provides the best tradeoff
between the estimation accuracy and overhead; (3) a performance
counter management mechanism for activity deployment. We
prototyped and evaluated REEWA in two real android smartphones. The results show that, compared to traditional estimation
methods, REEWA achieves an average 33% higher estimation
accuracy with a negligible overhead (less than 1%, worst-case).
We applied REEWA to support heterogeneous core scheduling for
web activities, which can help reduce 40% energy consumption.
