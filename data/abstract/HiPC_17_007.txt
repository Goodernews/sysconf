
Recent work have used both failure logs and resource use data separately (and together) to detect system failureinducing errors and to diagnose system failures. System failure
occurs as a result of error propagation and the (unsuccessful)
execution of error recovery mechanisms. Knowledge of error
propagation patterns and unsuccessful error recovery is important for more accurate and detailed failure diagnosis, and
knowledge of recovery protocols deployment is important for improving system reliability. This paper presents the CORRMEXT
framework which carries failure diagnosis another significant
step forward by analyzing and reporting error propagation
patterns and degrees of success and failure of error recovery
protocols. CORRMEXT uses both error messages and resource
use data in its analyses. Application of CORRMEXT to data
from the Ranger supercomputer have produced new insights.
CORRMEXT has: (i) identified correlations between resource
use counters that capture recovery attempts after an error, (ii)
identified correlations between error events to capture error
propagation patterns within the system, (iii) identified error
propagation and recovery paths during system execution to
explain system behaviour, (iv) showed that the earliest times of
change in system behaviour can only be identified by analyzing
both the correlated resource use counters and correlated errors.
CORRMEXT will be installed on the HPC clusters at the Texas
Advanced Computing Center in Autumn 2017.
