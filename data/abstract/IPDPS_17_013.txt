
With the explosive growth of smartphones and
cloud computing, mobile cloud, which leverages cloud resource
to boost the performance of mobile applications, becomes attractive. Many efforts have been made to improve the performance
and reduce energy consumption of mobile devices by offloading
computational codes to the cloud. However, the offloading cost
caused by the cloud platform has been ignored for many years.
In this paper, we propose Rattrap, a lightweight cloud platform
which improves the offloading performance from cloud side. To
achieve such goals, we analyze the characteristics of typical offloading workloads and design our platform solution accordingly.
Rattrap develops a new runtime environment, Cloud Android
Container, for mobile computation offloading, replacing heavyweight virtual machines (VMs). Our design exploits the idea
of running operating systems with differential kernel features
inside containers with driver extensions, which partially breaks
the limitation of OS-level virtualization. With proposed resource
sharing and code cache mechanism, Rattrap fundamentally
improves the offloading performance. Our evaluation shows
that Rattrap not only reduces the startup time of runtime
environments and shows an average speedup of 16x, but also
saves a large amount of system resources such as 75% memory
footprint and at least 79% disk capacity. Moreover, Rattrap
improves offloading response by as high as 63% over the cloud
platform based on VM, and thus saving the battery life.
