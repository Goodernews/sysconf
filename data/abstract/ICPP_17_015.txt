
Improving the performance of I/O virtualization is a
key issue for cloud and datacenter infrastructures, especially with
the rapid increase of network interconnection speeds. Previous
efforts have made the performance overhead associated with
the virtual I/O data path largely negligible. The remaining
bottlenecks mainly lie in the event path: hypervisor interventions
trigger costly virtual machine (VM) exits and lead to dramatical
performance degradation. Aiming at an optimal virtual I/O
event path, we propose ES2, a comprehensive scheme that
simultaneously improves bidirectional I/O event delivery between
guest VMs and their devices. ES2 can provide efficient I/O
request delivery, non-exit interrupt delivery and enhanced I/O
responsiveness. Moreover, it does not require any modification
to guest operating system (OS) or compromise any virtualization
benefit. We demonstrate that ES2 greatly reduces VM exit rate
with the time in guest (TIG) for I/O processing above 96%
for TCP streams and 99% for UDP streams, increases guest
throughput by 1.8x for Memcached and 2x for Apache, and keeps
guest latency at a very low level.
