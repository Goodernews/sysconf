a natural generalisation of oblivious transfer (OT) and a special
case of the notion of oblivious polynomial evaluation introduced by
Naor and Pinkas at STOC 1999. OLE works over a finite field F. In an
OLE the sender inputs two field elements a € F and b € F, and the
receiver inputs a field element x € F and learns only f(x) = ax +b.
Our protocol can evaluate an arithmetic circuit over a finite field
F given black-box access to OLE for F. The protocol is unconditionally secure and consumes only a constant number of OLEs per
multiplication gate. An OLE over a field F of size O(2*) can be
implemented with communication O(x). This gives a protocol with
communication complexity O(|C|x) for large enough fields, where
C is an arithmetic circuit computing the desired function.

This asymptotically matches the best previous protocols, but our
protocol at the same time obtains significantly smaller constants
hidden by the big-O notation, yielding a highly practical protocol.
Conceptually our techniques lift the techniques for basing practical
actively secure 2PC of Boolean circuits on OT introduced under the
name TinyOT by Nielsen, Nordholt, Orlandi and Burra at Crypto
2012 to the arithmetic setting. In doing so we develop several novel
techniques for generating various flavours of OLE and combining
these.

We believe that the efficiency of our protocols, both in asymptotic
and practical terms, establishes OLE and its variants as an important
foundation for efficient actively secure 2PC.
