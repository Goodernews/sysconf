
Personal Cloud Storage (PCS) is a very popular
Internet service. It allows users to backup data to the cloud
as well as to perform collaborative work while sharing content.
Notably, content sharing is a key feature for PCS users. It
however comes with extra costs for service providers, as shared
files must be synchronized to multiple user devices, generating
more downloads from cloud servers. Despite the increasing
interest in this type of service, a thorough investigation on the
costs and benefits of PCS for service providers and end users
has not been conducted yet. To that end, we propose a model to
analyze cost-benefit tradeoffs for both parties. We develop utility
functions that capture, in an abstract level, the satisfaction of the
service provider and users in various scenarios. Then, we apply
our model to evaluate alternative policies for content sharing
in PCS. We consider two alternative policies for the current
PCS sharing architecture, which count on user collaboration to
reduce providersâ€™ costs. Our results show that such policies are
advantageous for providers and users, leading to 39% utility
improvements for both parties, while requiring low commitment
of resources from participating users.!
