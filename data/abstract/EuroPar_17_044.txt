
. Supercomputers are becoming more heterogeneous. They are
composed by several machines with different computation capabilities
and different kinds and families of accelerators, such as GPUs or Intel
Xeon Phi coprocessors. Programming these machines is a hard task, that
requires a deep study of the architectural details, in order to exploit
efficiently each computational unit.

In this paper, we present an extension of a GPU-CPU heterogeneous
programming model, to include support for Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors.
This contribution extends the previous model and its implementation, by
taking advantage of both the GPU communication model and the CPU
execution model of the original approach, to derive a new approach for
the Xeon Phi. Our experimental results show that using our approach,
the programming effort needed for changing the kind of target devices
is highly reduced for several study cases. For example, using our model
to program a Mandelbrot benchmark, the 97% of the application code is
reused between a GPU implementation and a Xeon Phi implementation.
