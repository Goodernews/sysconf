enabled the production of China’s first independently developed number-one ranked supercomputer -— the Sunway
TaihuLight. The design of the limited off-chip memory bandwidth, however, renders the SW26010 a highly memory-bound
processor. To compensate for this limitation, the processor
was designed with a unique hardware feature, “Register Level
Communication” (RLC), to share register data among its
8 x 8 computing processing elements (CPEs) via a 2D onchip network. Such a radical architecture has sparked global
researchers’ concerns regarding the programming challenges
this may cause. To address these concerns, we adopted two
compute-bound scientific kernels as benchmarks to identify the
potential programming challenges. The first kernel is doubleprecision general matrix-multiplication (DGEMM). An RLCfriendly algorithm was designed for this kernel to reuse the data
that already reside in the registers of 64 CPEs. This novel optimization enables the kernel to achieve up to 88.7% efficiency
in one core group of the SW26010. This paper reveals, for
the first time, the details of how the highly efficient DGEMM
is implemented on the home-grown processor. The second
kernel that we used is N-body. Due to the inefficient hardware
support for transcendental operations on the SW26010, we
replaced the reciprocal square root (rsqrt) instruction of N-body
with a software routine to tackle the problem. Based on the
programming challenges identified through these two optimized
kernels, we proposed a three-level programming guideline for
the SW26010. The paper concludes with our crucial finding
that the critical step towards bridging the ninja performance
gap on the SW26010 is to design an RLC-friendly algorithm
to increase arithmetic intensity.
