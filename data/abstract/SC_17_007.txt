leading to a denial of service for all other tasks. This paper presents
a classful Token Bucket Filter (TBF) policy for the Lustre file system.
The TBF enforces Remote Procedure Call (RPC) rate limitations
based on (potentially complex) Quality of Service (QoS) rules. The
QoS rules are enforced in Lustre’s Object Storage Servers, where
each request is assigned to an automatically created QoS class.
The proposed QoS implementation for Lustre enables various
features for each class including the support for high-priority and
real-time requests even under heavy load and the utilization of spare
bandwidth by less important tasks under light load. The framework
also enables dependent rules to change a job’s RPC rate even at very
small timescales. Furthermore, we propose a Global Rate Limiting
(GRL) algorithm to enforce system-wide RPC rate limitations.
