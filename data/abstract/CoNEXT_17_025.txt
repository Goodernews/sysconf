

TCP does not work well in modern cellular networks because the

current congestion-window-based (cwnd-based) congestion control mechanism intimately couples congestion control and packet

dispatch, which provides TCP with only indirect control of the

effective data rate. The throughput degradation arising from the

cwnd-based mechanism is especially serious when the uplink is

congested. We describe PropRate, a new rate-based TCP algorithm

that directly regulates the packets in the bottleneck buffer to achieve
a trade-off in terms of delay and throughput along a more efficient

frontier than conventional cwnd-based TCP variants. To the best

of our knowledge, PropRate is the first TCP algorithm that allows

an application to set and achieve a target average latency, if the

network conditions allow for it. Also, unlike the cwnd-based TCP

mechanism, our new rate-based TCP mechanism is significantly

more resilient to saturated uplinks in cellular networks. PropRate

does not require modifications at the receiver and is amenable to

practical deployment in the base stations and proxies in mobile

cellular networks.
