The diversity of benchmarks is an important asset to evaluate novel approaches for effectiveness and weaknesses. In
this paper, we describe the memory characteristics and the
GC behavior of commonly used Java benchmarks, i.e., the
DaCapo benchmark suite, the DaCapo Scala benchmark
suite and the SPECjvm2008 benchmark suite. The paper
can serve as a useful guide to select benchmarks in accordance with desired application characteristics on modern
virtual machines as well as with different compilers and
garbage collectors. It also helps to put results that are
based on these benchmarks into perspective. Additionally,
we compare Javaâ€™s current default collector to the G1 GC.
