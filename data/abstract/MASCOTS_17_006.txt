
Memory price will continue dropping in the next
few years according to Gartner. Such trend renders it affordable for in-memory key-value stores (IMKVs) to maintain
redundant memory-resident copies of each key-value pair to
provision enhanced reliability and high availability services.
Though contemporary IMKVs have reached unprecedented
performance, delivering single-digit microsecond-scale latency
with up to tens of millions queries per second throughput,
existing replication protocols are unable to keep pace with such
an advancement of IMKVs, either incurring unbearable latency
overhead or demanding intensive resource usage. Consequently,
the adoption of those replication techniques always results in
substantial performance degradation.

In this paper, we propose MacR, a RDMA-based highperformance and lightweight replication protocol for IMKVs.
The design of MacR centers around sharing the remote backup
memory to enable RDMA-based replication protocol, and
synthesizes a collection of optimizations, including memory
allocator cooperative replication and adaptive bulk data synchronization to control the number of network operations and to
enhance the recovery performance. Performance evaluations
with a variety of YCSB workloads demonstrate that MacR can
efficiently outperform alternative replication methods in terms
of the throughput while preserving sufficiently low latency
overhead. It can also efficiently speed up the recovery process.
