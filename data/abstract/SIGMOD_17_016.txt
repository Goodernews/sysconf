accesses only pages that contain data to be retrieved by a query.
Therefore, effective data partitioning is required to minimize the
number of page accesses. However, it is an NP-hard problem to
obtain optimal data partitioning given query pattern and data distribution.

We propose a framework that involves a multidimensional indexing technique based on a space-filling curve. A space-filling
curve is a way to define which portion of data can be stored in the
same page. Therefore, the problem can be interpreted as selecting a
curve that distributes data to be accessed by a query to minimize the
number of page accesses. To solve this problem, we analyzed how
different space-filling curves affect the number of page accesses.
We found that it is critical for a curve to fit a query pattern and be
robust against any data distribution. We propose a cost model for
measuring how well a space-filling curve fits a given query pattern
and tolerates data skew. Also we propose a method for designing a
query-aware and skew-tolerant curve for a given query pattern.

We prototyped our framework using the defined query-aware
and skew-tolerant curve. We conducted experiments using a skew
data set, and confirmed that our framework can reduce the number of page accesses by an order of magnitude for data warehousing (DWH) and geographic information systems (GIS) applications
with real-world data.
