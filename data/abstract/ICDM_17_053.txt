
An interesting observation about the well-known
ADABOOST algorithm is that, though theory suggests it should
overfit when applied to noisy data, experiments indicate it often
does not do so in practice. In this paper, we study the behavior
of ADABOOST on datasets with one-sided uniform class noise
using linear classifiers as the base learner. We show analytically
that, under some ideal conditions, this approach will not overfit,
and can in fact recover a zero-error concept with respect to the
true, uncorrupted instance labels. We also analytically show that
ADABOOST increases the margins of predictions over boosting
iterations, as has been previously suggested in the literature.
We then compare the empirical behavior of ADABOOST using
real world datasets with one-sided noise derived from multipleinstance data. Although our assumptions may not hold in a
practical setting, our experiments show that standard ADABOOST
still performs well, as suggested by our analysis, and often
outperforms baseline variations in the literature that explicitly
try to account for noise.
