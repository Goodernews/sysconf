rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective
model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph
setting, there are two main problems: support measure and
search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for constructing support measures that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based support
measures. Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present
two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure
and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine
the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show
that the existing minimum-image-based support measure is
an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time
computable and results in counts that are close to number of
instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NPhard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for
both measures and bounding theorems for all presented support measures in the hypergraph setting. We further show
that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all support
measures studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of support measures can be defined
and profiled in it.
