data. Though powerful, SQL queries can be difficult to
write due to their highly expressive constructs. Using the
programming-by-example paradigm to help users write SQL
queries presents an attractive proposition, as evidenced by online help forums such as Stack Overflow. However, developing techniques to synthesize SQL queries from input-output
(I/O) examples has been difficult due to SQLâ€™s rich set of
operators.
In this paper, we present a new scalable and efficient algorithm to synthesize SQL queries from I/O examples. Our
key innovation is the development of a language for abstract
queries, i.e., queries with uninstantiated operators, that can express a large space of SQL queries efficiently. Using abstract
queries to represent the search space nicely decomposes the
synthesis problem into two tasks: (1) searching for abstract
queries that can potentially satisfy the given I/O examples,
and (2) instantiating the found abstract queries and ranking
the results. We implemented the algorithm in a new tool,
called S CYTHE, and evaluated it on 193 benchmarks collected from Stack Overflow. Our results showed that S CYTHE
efficiently solved 74% of the benchmarks, most in just a few
seconds. Queries synthesized by S CYTHE range from simple
ones involving a single selection to complex ones with six
levels of nested queries.
