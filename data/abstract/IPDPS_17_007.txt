
Finding regions of local similarity between biological sequences is a fundamental task in computational biology.
BLAST is the most widely-used tool for this purpose, but
it suffers from irregularities due to its heuristic nature. To
achieve fast search, recent approaches construct the index from
the database instead of the input query. However, database
indexing introduces more challenges in the design of index
structure and algorithm, especially for data access through the
memory hierarchy on modern multicore processors.

In this paper, based on existing heuristic algorithms, we
design and develop a database indexed BLAST with the identical sensitivity as query indexed BLAST (i.e., NCBI-BLAST).
Then, we identify that existing heuristic algorithms of BLAST
can result in serious irregularities in database indexed search.
To eliminate irregularities in BLAST algorithm, we propose
muBLASTP, that uses multiple optimizations to improve data
locality and parallel efficiency for multicore architectures and
multi-node systems. Experiments on a single node demonstrate
up to a 5.1-fold speedup over the multi-threaded NCBI BLAST.
For the inter-node parallelism, we achieve nearly linear scaling
on up to 128 nodes and gain up to 8.9-fold speedup over
mpiBLAST.
