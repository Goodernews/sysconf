However, such bandwidth adaptation operates based on the "symptoms" of congestion (e.g., increased delay) without knowing the
underlying cause (self-congestion vs. cross-traffic). In this paper,
we consider this problem in the context of Wi-Fi networks and
introduce a novel technique, Ping-Pair, to measure and attribute
congestion. We have integrated Ping-Pair into the popular Skype
audio-video conferencing application to enable improved bandwidth adaptation dubbed Kwikr, using which we have conducted
controlled experiments and also randomized A/B tests in a production setting.
