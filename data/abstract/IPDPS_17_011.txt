DEFT-cache, Delayed Erasing and Fast Taping, that maximizes
I/O performance and reliability of RAID storage. First of all,
DEFT-Cache exploits the inherent physical properties of flash
memory SSD by making use of old data that have been overwritten but still in existence in SSD to minimize small write penalty of
RAID5/6. As data pages being overwritten in SSD, old data pages
are invalidated and become candidates for erasure and garbage
collections. Our idea is to selectively delay the erasure of the
pages and let these otherwise useless old data in SSD contribute
to I/O performance for parity computations upon write I/Os.
Secondly, DEFT-Cache provides inexpensive redundancy to the
SSD cache by having one physical SSD and one virtual SSD
as a mirror cache. The virtual SSD is implemented on HDD
but using log-structured data layout, i.e. write data are quickly
logged to HDD using sequential write. The dual and redundant
caches provide a cost-effective and highly reliable write-back
SSD cache. We have implemented DEFT-Cache on Linux system.
Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the
potential benefits of our new techniques. Experimental results on
SPC and Microsoft traces have shown that DEFT-Cache improves
I/O performance by 26.81% to 56.26% in terms of average user
response time. The virtual SSD mirror cache can absorb write
I/Os as fast as physical SSD providing the same reliability as two
physical SSD caches without noticeable performance loss.
