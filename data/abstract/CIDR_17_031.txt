
Deciding query equivalence is an important problem in data management with many practical applications. Solving the problem,
however, is not an easy task. While there has been a lot of work
done in the database research community in reasoning about the
semantic equivalence of SQL queries, prior work mainly focuses
on theoretical limitations. In this paper, we present COSETTE, a
fully automated prover that can determine the equivalence of SQL
queries. COSETTE leverages recent advances in both automated
constraint solving and interactive theorem proving, and returns a
counterexample (in terms of input relations) if two queries are not
equivalent, or a proof of equivalence otherwise. Although the problem of determining equivalence for arbitrary SQL queries is undecidable, our experiments show that COSETTE can determine the
equivalences of a wide range of queries that arise in practice, including conjunctive queries, correlated queries, queries with outer
joins, and queries with aggregates. Using COSETTE, we have also
proved the validity of magic set rewrites, and confirmed various
real-world query rewrite errors, including the famous COUNT bug.
We are unaware of any prior tool that can automatically determine the equivalences of a broad range of queries as COSETTE,
and believe that our tool represents a major step towards building
provably-correct query optimizers for real-world database systems.
