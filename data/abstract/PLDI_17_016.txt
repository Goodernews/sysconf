
We introduce DEMOMATCH, a tool for API discovery that
allows the user to discover how to implement functionality
using a software framework by demonstrating the function-
ality in existing applications built with the same framework.
DEMOMATCH matches the demonstrations against a database
of execution traces called SEMERU and generates code snip-
pets explaining how to use the functionality. We evaluated
DEMOMATCH on several case studies involving Java Swing
and Eclipse RCP.
