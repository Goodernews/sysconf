higher resource utilization to better amortize capital costs. Higher
utilization not only can enable higher profit for IaaS providers but
also provides a mechanism to raise energy efficiency; therefore
creating greener cloud services. Unfortunately, achieving high utilization is difficult mainly due to infrastructure providers needing
to maintain spare capacity to service demand fluctuations.
Graceful degradation is a self-adaptation technique originally
designed for constructing robust services that survive resource
shortages. Previous work has shown that graceful degradation can
also be used to improve resource utilization in the cloud by absorbing demand fluctuations and reducing spare capacity. In this work,
we build a system and pricing model that enables infrastructure
providers to incentivize their tenants to use graceful degradation.
By using graceful degradation with an appropriate pricing model,
the infrastructure provider can realize higher resource utilization
while simultaneously, its tenants can increase their profit. Our proposed solution is based on a hybrid model which guarantees both
reserved and peak on-demand capacities over flexible periods. It
also includes a global dynamic price pair for capacity which remains
uniform during each tenant’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) term.
We evaluate our scheme using simulations based on real-world
traces and also implement a prototype using RUBiS on the Xen
hypervisor as an end-to-end demonstration. Our analysis shows
that the proposed scheme never hurts a tenant’s net profit, but can
improve it by as much as 93%. Simultaneously, it can also improve
the effective utilization of contracts from 42% to as high as 99%.
