Internet-scale SYN scans. These classification techniques work under an assumption that all parameters of the profiled network are
known a-priori â€” the likelihood of packet loss, the popularity of
each OS, the distribution of network delay, and the probability of
user modification to each default TCP/IP header value. However,
it is currently unclear how to obtain realistic versions of these parameters for the public Internet and/or customize them to a particular network being analyzed. To address this issue, we derive a
non-parametric Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimator, which
we call Faulds, for the unknown distributions involved in singleprobe OS fingerprinting and demonstrate its significantly higher
robustness to noise compared to methods in prior work. We apply
Faulds to a new scan of 67M webservers and discuss its findings.
