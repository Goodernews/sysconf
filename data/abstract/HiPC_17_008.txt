
The ever-increasing energy demands of modern High
Performance Computing (HPC) platforms is undeniably one of
the most critical aspects for the future design and evolution
of such systems. The capability of managing their energy
consumption not only allows for significant reduction in electricity costs but is also a step forward on the road towards
the exascale. Powercapping is a widely studied technique that
contributes to address this challenge by instantaneously setting
and maintaining a predefined power threshold (power cap)
that cannot be exceeded. However, the lack of a centralized
mechanism responsible for efficiently allocating the available
power among resources and jobs may ultimately yield to fragmentation, low system utilization and increased user waiting
times. Additionally, power cap violations can lead to high
risk scenarios and/or increase operational costs. This paper
proposes to prevent such issues with the introduction of the
Enhanced Power Adaptive Scheduling (E-PAS) algorithm. The
E-PAS algorithm combines scheduling and resource management mechanisms, correlating estimated and real power
consumption data in order to optimize the resource utilization
of the platform under a predefined power cap. The algorithm
has been implemented in the widely used open-source resource
and job management system SLURM and is planned to be
pushed in a future mainstream version. Its effectiveness has
been evaluated through real-scale experiments respectively on
an ARM- and an Intel-based cluster of comparable size. All
experiments have been performed using synthetic workloads
from a set of mini-applications.
