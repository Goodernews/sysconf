the memory and context of guest virtual machines (VMs).
VM isolation is an efficient mechanism for protecting the
memory of guest VMs from unauthorized access. However, previous VM isolation systems either modify hardware
architecture or introduce a software module without being
protected, and most of them focus on the x86 architecture.

This paper proposes HA-VMSI, a lightweight hardwareassisted VM isolation approach for ARM, to provide runtime protection of guest VMs, even with a compromised hypervisor. In the ARM TrustZone secure world, a thin security monitor is introduced as HA-VMSI’s entire TCB. Hence,
the security monitor is much less vulnerable and safe from
attacks that can compromise the hypervisor. The key of HAVMSI is decoupling the functions of memory isolation among VMs from the hypervisor into the security monitor.
As a result, the hypervisor can only update the Stage-2 page
tables of VMs via the security monitor, which inspects and
approves each new mapping. It is worth noting that HAVMSI is more secure and effective than current software approaches, and more flexible and compatible than hardware
approaches. We have implemented a prototype for KVM hypervisor with multiple Linux as guest OSes on Juno board.
The security assessment and performance evaluation show
that HA-VMSLI is effective, efficient and practical.
