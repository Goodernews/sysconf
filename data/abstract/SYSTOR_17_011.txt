
The exponential growth of data produced, the ever faster
and ubiquitous connectivity, and the collaborative processing tools lead to a clear shift of data stores from local
servers to the cloud. This migration occurring across different application domains and types of users—individual
or corporate—raises two immediate challenges. First, outsourcing data introduces security risks, hence protection
mechanisms must be put in place to provide guarantees such
as privacy, confidentiality and integrity. Second, there is no
“one-size-fits-all” solution that would provide the right level
of safety or performance for all applications and users, and
it is therefore necessary to provide mechanisms that can be
tailored to the various deployment scenarios.

In this paper, we address both challenges by introducing
SAFEFS, a modular architecture based on software-defined
storage principles featuring stackable building blocks that
can be combined to construct a secure distributed file system. SAFEFS allows users to specialize their data store to
their specific needs by choosing the combination of blocks
that provide the best safety and performance tradeoffs. The
file system is implemented in user space using FUSE and can
access remote data stores. The provided building blocks notably include mechanisms based on encryption, replication,
and coding. We implemented SAFEF'S and performed indepth evaluation across a range of workloads. Results reveal
that while each layer has a cost, one can build safe yet efficient storage architectures. Furthermore, the different combinations of blocks sometimes yield surprising tradeoffs.
