
Computed Tomography (CT) Image Reconstruction is an important technique used in a variety of domains, including medical imaging, electron microscopy, non-destructive testing and
transportation security. Model-based Iterative Reconstruction
(MBIR) using Iterative Coordinate Descent (ICD) is a CT algorithm that produces state-of-the-art results in terms of image
quality. However, MBIR is highly computationally intensive
and challenging to parallelize, and has traditionally been viewed
as impractical in applications where reconstruction time is critical. We present the first GPU-based algorithm for ICD-based
MBIR. The algorithm leverages the recently-proposed concept
of SuperVoxels [1], and efficiently exploits the three levels of
parallelism available in MBIR to better utilize the GPU hardware resources. We also explore data layout transformations to
obtain more coalesced accesses and several GPU-specific optimizations for MBIR that boost performance. Across a suite of
3200 test cases, our GPU implementation obtains a geometric
mean speedup of 4.43X over a state-of-the-art multi-core implementation on a 16-core iso-power CPU.
