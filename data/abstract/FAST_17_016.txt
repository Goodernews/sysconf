
Anomalies in the runtime behavior of software systems,
especially in distributed systems, are inevitable, expensive, and hard to locate. To detect and correct such
anomalies (like instability due to a growing memory
consumption, failure due to load spikes, etc.) one has
to automatically collect, store, and analyze the operational data of the runtime behavior, often represented as
time series. There are efficient means both to collect and
analyze the runtime behavior. But traditional time series databases do not yet focus on the specific needs of
anomaly detection (generic data model, specific built-in
functions, storage efficiency, and fast query execution).
The paper presents Chronix, a domain specific time series database targeted at anomaly detection in operational
data. Chronix uses an ideal compression and chunking of
the time series data, a methodology for commissioning
Chronixâ€™ parameters to a sweet spot, a way of enhancing the data with attributes, an expandable set of analysis functions, and other techniques to achieve both faster
query times and a significantly smaller memory footprint. On benchmarks Chronix saves 20%-68% of the
space that other time series databases need to store the
data and saves 80%-92% of the data retrieval time and
73%-97% of the runtime of analyzing functions.
