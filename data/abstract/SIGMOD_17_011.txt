network analysis, it has always been an important, yet challenging, topic to accurately infer/reconstruct gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) from microarray data, and efficiently identify those matching GRNs with similar interaction structures for potential disease
analysis and treatment tasks. Motivated by this, in this paper, we
formalize the problem of ad-hoc inference and matching over gene
regulatory networks (IM-GRN), which deciphers ad-hoc GRN graph
structures online from gene feature databases (without full GRN
materializations), and retrieves the inferred GRNs that are subgraphisomorphic to a query GRN graph with high confidences. Specifically, we propose a novel probabilistic score to measure the possible interaction between any two genes (inferred from gene feature vectors), and thus model GRNs by probabilistic graphs, containing edge existence probabilities. In order to efficiently process
IM-GRN queries, we propose effective reduction, pruning, and embedding strategies to significantly reduce the search space of GRN
inference and matching, without materializing all GRNs. We also
present an effective indexing mechanism and an efficient IM-GRN
query processing algorithm by the index traversal. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of our proposed IM-GRN query answering approaches over real/synthetic GRN data sets.
