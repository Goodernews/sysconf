A (2-party) HSS scheme splits an input x into shares (x°, x!) such
that (1) each share computationally hides x, and (2) there exists
an efficient homomorphic evaluation algorithm Eval such that for
any function (or “program”) P from a given class it holds that
Eval(x°, P) +Eval(x!, P) = P(x). Boyle et al. show how to construct
an HSS scheme for branching programs, with an inverse polynomial
error, using discrete-log type assumptions such as DDH.

We make two types of contributions.

OPTIMIZATIONS. We introduce new optimizations that speed up the
previous optimized implementation of Boyle et al. by more than a
factor of 30, significantly reduce the share size, and reduce the rate
of leakage induced by selective failure.

APPLICATIONS. Our optimizations are motivated by the observation
that there are natural application scenarios in which HSS is useful
even when applied to simple computations on short inputs. We
demonstrate the practical feasibility of our HSS implementation in
the context of such applications.
