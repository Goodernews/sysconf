
The Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) method
allows scientists to treat the dynamics of molecular and condensed
phase systems while retaining a first-principles-based description
of their interactions. This extremely important method has
tremendous computational requirements, because the electronic
Schr√©dinger equation, approximated using Kohn-Sham Density
Functional Theory (DFT), is solved at every time step.

With the advent of manycore architectures, application developers have a significant amount of processing power within
each compute node that can only be exploited through massive
parallelism. A compute intensive application such as AIMD forms
a good candidate to leverage this processing power.

In this paper, we focus on adding thread level parallelism
to the plane wave DFT methodology implemented in NWChem.
Through a careful optimization of tall-skinny matrix products,
which are at the heart of the Lagrange multiplier and nonlocal pseudopotential kernels, as well as 3D FFTs, our OpenMP
implementation delivers excellent strong scaling on the latest Intel
Knights Landing (KNL) processor. We assess the efficiency of
our Lagrange multiplier kernels by building a Roofline model
of the platform, and verify that our implementation is close to
the roofline for various problem sizes. Finally, we present strong
scaling results on the complete AIMD simulation for a 64 water
molecules test case, that scales up to all 68 cores of the Knights
Landing processor.
