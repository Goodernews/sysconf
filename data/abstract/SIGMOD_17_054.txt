suffers when the workload characteristics miss their small sweet
spot of a desired contention level, read-write ratio, record size, processing rate, and so forth.

Cicada is a single-node multi-core in-memory transactional database with serializability. To provide high performance under diverse
workloads, Cicada reduces overhead and contention at several levels
of the system by leveraging optimistic and multi-version concurrency control schemes and multiple loosely synchronized clocks
while mitigating their drawbacks. On the TPC-C and YCSB benchmarks, Cicada outperforms Silo, TicToc, FOEDUS, MOCC, twophase locking, Hekaton, and ERMIA in most scenarios, achieving
up to 3X higher throughput than the next fastest design. It handles
up to 2.07 M TPC-C transactions per second and 56.5 M YCSB
transactions per second, and scans up to 356 M records per second
on a single 28-core machine.
