
With the vigorous development of network applications, typical SDN (Software Defined Networks) such as data
centers are gradually carrying more and more complex network
traffic. This poses a great challenge for network monitoring â€”
how to realize real-time, high-accuracy capture of traffic changes
at low cost. In this paper, we propose a trigger-based monitoring
approach called EffiView. This approach provides three ways to
monitor flow statistics, including flow-stat triggering, FlowRemoved parsing and active polling. The flow-stat triggering can
occur on all multiples of the presupposed flow-stat threshold
for each flow entry. The latter two ways are complementary to
the flow-stat triggering. FlowRemoved parsing is used to acquire
flow statistics from FlowRemoved messages and active polling
is conditionally carried out by the controller at the expiration
of monitoring period. EffiView achieves low-cost monitoring
by combining the three ways efficiently, while ensuring high
accuracy and fine granularity. Based on the NetMagic platform,
We implement EffiView and evaluate its monitoring performance.
The experimental results show that EffiView can reach great
advantages over traditional monitoring approaches.
