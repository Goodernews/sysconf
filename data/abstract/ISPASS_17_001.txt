
Managed applications, written in programming languages such as Java, C# and others, represent a significant
share of workloads in the mobile, desktop, and server domains.
Microarchitectural timing simulation of such workloads is useful
for characterization and performance analysis, of both hardware
and software, as well as for research and development of novel
hardware extensions.

This paper introduces MaxSim, a simulation platform based
on the Maxine VM, the ZSim simulator, and the McPAT modeling
framework. MaxSim is able to simulate fast and accurately
managed workloads running on top of Maxine VM and its
capabilities are showcased with novel simulation techniques for:
1) low-intrusive microarchitectural profiling via pointer tagging
on the x86-64 platforms, 2) modeling of hardware extensions
related, but not limited to, tagged pointers, and 3) modeling of
complex software changes via address-space morphing.

Low-intrusive microarchitectural profiling is achieved by utilizing tagged pointers to collect type- and allocation-site- related
hardware events. Furthermore, MaxSim allows, through a novel
technique called address space morphing, the easy modeling of
complex object layout transformations. Finally, through the codesigned capabilities of MaxSim, novel hardware extensions can
be implemented and evaluated.

We showcase MaxSimâ€™s capabilities by simulating the whole
set of the DaCapo-9.12-bach benchmarks in less than a day
while performing an up-to-date microarchitectural power and
performance characterization. Furthermore, we demonstrate a
hardware/software co-designed optimization that performs dynamic load elimination for array length retrieval achieving up to
14% L1 data cache loads reduction and up to 4% dynamic energy
reduction. MaxSim is available at https://github.com/arodchen/
MaxSim released as free software.
