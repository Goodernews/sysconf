
. As the complexity and diversity of computer hardware and
the elaborateness of network technologies have made the implementation of portable and efficient algorithms more challenging, the need to
understand application communication patterns has become increasingly
relevant. This paper presents details of the design and evaluation of a
communication-monitoring infrastructure developed in the Open MPI
software stack that can expose a dynamically configurable level of detail
concerning application communication patterns.
