
One of the main motivations for the shift to the Cloud (and
the more recent shift of telco operators into NFV) is cost
reduction due to high utilization of infrastructure resources.
However, achieving high utilization in practical scenarios is
complex since the term “resources” covers diferent orthogonal aspects, such as server CPU, storage (or disk) usage and
network capacity, and the workload characterization varies
over time and over diferent users.

In this paper we study the placement of Virtual Machines
(VMs) that implement services over the physical inrastructure, trying to understand what makes a placement scheme
better than others in the overall utilization of the various
resources. We show that the multidimensional case is inherently diferent from the single dimension case, and develop
novel placement heuristics to address the speciic challenges.
We then show, by extensive evaluation over real data, that
operators can signiicantly improve their resource utilization
by selecting the most appropriate placement policy, according to their system speciications and the deployed services.
In particular, two of our new heuristics that dynamically
change the placement logic according to the amount of available (unused) resources are shown to perform very well in
many practical scenarios.
