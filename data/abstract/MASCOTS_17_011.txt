
In this paper we study how to estimate the
back-off rates in an idealized CSMA network consisting
of 7 links to achieve a given throughput vector using free
energy approximations. More specifically, we introduce
the class of region-based free energy approximations with
clique belief and present a closed form expression for the
back-off rates based on the zero gradient points of the
free energy approximation (in terms of the conflict graph,
target throughput vector and counting numbers).

Next we introduce the size kmaz clique free energy
approximation as a special case and derive an explicit
expression for the counting numbers, as well as a
recursion to compute the back-off rates. We subsequently
show that the size k,,., clique approximation coincides
with a Kikuchi free energy approximation and prove that
it is exact on chordal conflict graphs when kmaz = n.
As a by-product these results provide us with an explicit
expression of a fixed point of the inverse generalized
belief propagation algorithm for CSMA networks.
