
We study a fundamental problem of how to
schedule complex workflows in the cloud for applications
such as data analytics. One of the main challenges is that
such workflow scheduling problems involve many constraints,
requirements and varied objectives and it is extremely difficult
to find high-quality solutions. To meet the challenge, we explore
using mixed integer programming (MIP) to formulate and solve
complex workflow scheduling problems. To illustrate the MIPbased method, we formulate three related workflow scheduling
problems in MIP. They are fairly generic, comprehensive and
are expected to be useful for a wide range of workflow scheduling scenarios. Using results from numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that, for problems up to certain size, the MIP
approach is entirely applicable and more advantageous over
heuristic algorithms.
