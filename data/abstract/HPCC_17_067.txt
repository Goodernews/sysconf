
Collaborative cloud storage environment, which
share resources of multiple geographically distributed datacenters
owned by different providers enable scientific workflow from
different locations to process large scale big intermediate data
through the Internet. Distributed datacenters are federated and
each member can collaborate with each other to efficiently share
and process the intermediate data from distributed workflow
instances. This paper focuses on the storage cost minimization
of intermediate data placement in federated cloud datacenters.
Through collaborative and federation mechanisms, we propose an
exact federation data placement algorithm based on integer linear
programming model (ILP) to assist multiple datacenters hosting
intermediate data files generated from a scientific workflow.
Under the constraints of the problem, the proposed algorithm
finds an optimal intermediate data placement with a cost saving
over the federated cloud datacenters, taking into account scientific
user requirements, data dependency and size. Experimental
results show the cost-efficiency of the proposed cloud storage
federation algorithm.
