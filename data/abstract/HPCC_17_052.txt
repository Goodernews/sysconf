
The Shopping Mall is in many countries a
focus point for the lives of the people. It is the place where
people go and shop, and in a certain sense it has become
the modern equivalent of a square. Along the years, this
attraction center has followed a definite evolutionary path,
becoming wider, bigger, looking to maximize the comfort
of the customers: a better place, for better sales. In this
paper, we analyze the shopping mall under a different
perspective, and check if this evolutionary line is in fact
the best possible one, or if instead the mall could be shaped
differently. We propose a structural modification of the
mall (halving), and analyze its impact on the efficiency
(the attractiveness of the shops). Counterintuitively, we
find that this structural modification leads to a significant
increase in the overall mall performance, a result that
impacts the recent evolution of the mall, and that suggests
that the mall as we know it might be far from being the
best one, and some radical changes could be in order.
