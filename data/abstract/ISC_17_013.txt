
. This study compares the performance of high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite elements on modern hardware. The main computational kernel is the matrix-free evaluation of differential operators
by sum factorization, exemplified on the symmetric interior penalty discretization of the Laplacian as a metric for a complex application code in
fluid dynamics. State-of-the-art implementations of these kernels stress
both arithmetics and memory transfer. The implementations of SIMD
vectorization and shared-memory parallelization are detailed. Computational results are presented for dual-socket Intel Haswell CPUs at 28
cores, a 64-core Intel Knights Landing, and a 16-core IBM Power8 processor. Up to polynomial degree six, Knights Landing is approximately twice
as fast as Haswell. Power8 performs similarly to Haswell, trading a higher
frequency for narrower SIMD units. The performance comparison shows
that simple ways to express parallelism through for loops perform better
on medium and high core counts than a more elaborate task-based parallelization with dynamic scheduling according to dependency graphs,
despite less memory transfer in the latter algorithm.
