
Auto-scaling, a key property of cloud computing,
allows application owners to acquire and release resources
on demand. However, the shared environment, along with the
exponentially large configuration space of available parameters,
makes configuration of auto-scaling policies a challenging task. In
particular, it is difficult to quantify, a priori, the impact of a policy
on Quality of Service (QoS) provision. To address this problem,
we propose a novel approach based on performance modelling
and formal verification to produce performance guarantees
on particular rule-based auto-scaling policies. We demonstrate
the usefulness and efficiency of our model through a detailed
validation process on the Amazon EC2 cloud, using two types
of load patterns. Our experimental results show that it can be
very effective in helping a cloud application owner configure an
auto-scaling policy in order to minimise the QoS violations.
