
Vehicular ad hoc networks play an important role
in current intelligent transportation networks which have gained
much attention from academia and industry. The vehicular
networks can be implemented by the LTE/LTE-A networks,
which have been formally defined in a series of standards by the
third generation partnership projects (3GPP). There are lots of
challenges in the authentication processes in the LTE/LTE-A. In
this paper, aimed to improve the security functionality of the
vehicular networks, a new secure and efficient group
authentication and key agreement scheme for the vehicular
networks has been proposed, named as the GAKAV. Compared
with the existing schemes, the proposed scheme can greatly
reduce the amount of control message transmission from mass of
vehicular equipment (VEs) to the network and avoid much
overhead in the LTE/LTE-A networks. Besides, it has the
following security functions including privacy preservation, nonframeability and non-repudiation verification.
