
Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive RandomAccess Memory (STT-MRAM) is a promising memory
technology, which has high density, fast read speed, low
leakage power, and non-volatility, and is suitable for multi-core
on-chip last-level caches. However, the high write energy and
latency, as well as less-than-desirable write endurance of STTMRAM remain challenges. This paper proposes a new encoded
content-aware cache replacement policy to reduce the total
switch bits for write, lower the write energy, and improve write
endurance. Instead of replacing the LRU block under the
conventional pseudo-LRU replacement policy, we select a
replacement block near the LRU position, which has the most
similar content to the missed block. The selected replacement
block can reduce the switch bits without damaging the cache
performance. To avoid fetching and comparing the entire block
contents, we present a novel content encoding method to
encode 64-byte block using just 8 bits, each bit represents 8byte content. The encoded bit is determined by the presence of
a dominant bit value in the 8 bytes. We measure the content
similarity using the Hamming distance between the encoded
bits of the missed block and the replaced block. Performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed simple content
encoding method is effective with an average of 20.5%
reduction in total switch bits, which results in improvement on
write endurance and less write energy consumption. These
improvements are accomplished with low overhead and
minimum impact on the cache performance.
