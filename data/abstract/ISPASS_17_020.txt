
 Graphics-as-a-service (GaaS) is gaining popularity
in cloud computing community. There is an emerging trend of
running GaaS workload using virtualized GPU in current data
center deployment. This paper provides a _ detailed
characterization of GaaS workload under virtualized GPU
NUMA environment, and found that: (1) GaaS workloads exhibit
different behavior with GPGPU workloads by having more
frequent real-time data exchange between CPU and GPU; (2)
GaaS workloads have no NUMA overhead, whether considering
the influence of remote memory access or the resource contention
of CPU uncore. We also test the performance and power tradeoff
among the frequency scaling of CPU clock, GPU core clock, and
GPU memory clock. Characterization results show that (1)
ondemand CPU frequency scaling achieves the best balance
between performance and power consumption; (2) GaaS
workloads are GPU-computation intensive. GPU memory
frequency can be set lower to save energy with little performance
sacrifice.
