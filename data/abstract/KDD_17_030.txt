
voxels in a typical fMRI scan can be grouped into 116 anatomical
regions[16]; what is unknown is how those regions are coactive to
form a functional network for different tasks. Our earlier work[4]
addresses this problem by adding strong supervision in the form of
the anatomical regionsâ€™ boundaries.
In this paper we remove this requirement that the regions are
given and instead require our method to discover their boundaries
and the connectivity between them without supervision. Figure 1
shows a simplified example involving a single slice of brain activity.
This problem is particularly difficult given that these studies rarely
involve more than 100 patients, rendering methods such as deep
learning inapplicable.

A common problem with spatiotemporal data is how to simplify the
data to discover an underlying network that consists of cohesive
spatial regions (nodes) and relationships between those regions
(edges). This network discovery problem naturally exists in a multitude of domains including climate data (dipoles), astronomical data
(gravitational lensing) and the focus of this paper, fMRI scans of human subjects. Whereas previous work requires strong supervision,
we propose an unsupervised matrix tri-factorization formulation
with complex constraints and spatial regularization. We show that
this formulation works well in controlled experiments with synthetic networks and is able to recover the underlying ground-truth
network. We then show that for real fMRI data our approach can
reproduce well known results in neurology regarding the default
mode network in resting-state healthy and Alzheimer affected individuals.
