Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of the most popular recommendation approaches; the original user-product rating matrix R. with
millions of rows and columns is decomposed into a user matrix Q
and an item matrix P, such that the product Q’P approximates
R. Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors of the
corresponding user (item), and q’'p is a prediction of the rating
to item p by user q. Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores in q’ P. For
this problem, we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval
(FEXIPRO) framework, based on sequential scan, which includes
three elements. First, FEXIPRO applies an SVD transformation to
P, after which the first several dimensions capture a large percentage of the inner products. This enables us to prune item vectors
by only computing their partial inner products with q. Second, we
construct an integer approximation version of P, which can be used
to compute fast upper bounds for the inner products that can prune
item vectors. Finally, we apply a lossless transformation to P, such
that the resulting matrix has only positive values, allowing for the
inner products to be monotonically increasing with dimensionality.
Experiments on real data demonstrate that our framework outperforms alternative approaches typically by an order of magnitude.
