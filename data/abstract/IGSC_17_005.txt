
With the increase in number of processing chips in
platform based computation intensive systems such as servers, a
seamless, scalable, energy efficient and high bandwidth
interconnection network is required. Newly envisioned silicon
interposers with Network-on-Chip (NoC) interconnection
framework have emerged as an energy efficient technology for
2.5D integration of multiple processor and memory chips, where
multiple chips are mounted on another die called the interposer
and are interconnected using the metal layers of the interposer die.
However, conventional interposer based multichip integration is
limited to edge-to-edge connections between the adjacent dies
leaving the interposerâ€™s routing resources underutilized. In this
paper, we propose large scale utilization of the available abundant
interposer resources for multichip integration by implementing a
hypercube interconnection architecture in an interposer for chipto-chip communication. Through system level simulations, we
demonstrate that such multichip system integrated with
interposer can provide high bandwidth and energy-efficient
communication under various traffic patterns.
