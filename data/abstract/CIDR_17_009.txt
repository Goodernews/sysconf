
After four decades of research, today’s database systems still suf-
fer from poor query execution plans. Bad plans are usually caused
by poor cardinality estimates, which have been called the “Achilles
Heel” of modern query optimizers. In this work we propose index-
based join sampling, a novel cardinality estimation technique for
main-memory databases that relies on sampling and existing in-
dex structures to obtain accurate estimates. Results on a real-world
data set show that this approach significantly improves estimation
as well as overall plan quality. The additional sampling effort is
quite low and can be configured to match the desired application
profile. The technique can be easily integrated into most systems.
