their input data across many machines for parallel execution. At
scale, it is likely that some machines will perform worse than
others because they are slower, power constrained or dependent
on undesirable, dirty energy sources. It is challenging to balance
analytics workloads across heterogeneous machines, because the
algorithms are sensitive to statistical skew in data partitions. A
skewed partition can slow down the whole workload or degrade
the quality of results. Sizing partitions in proportion to each
machineâ€™s performance may introduce or further exacerbate
skew. In this paper, we propose a scheme that controls the
statistical distribution of each partition and sizes partitions
according to the heterogeneity of the computing environment.
We model heterogeneity as a multi-objective optimization, with
the objectives being functions for execution time and dirty energy
consumption. We use stratification to control skew. Experiments
show that our computational heterogeneity aware (Het-Aware)
partitioning strategy speeds up running time by up to 51%
over the stratified partitioning scheme baseline. We also have a
heterogeneity and energy aware (Het-Energy-Aware) partitioning
scheme which is slower than the Het-Aware solution, but can
lower the dirty energy footprint by up to 26%. For some analytic
tasks there is also a significant qualitative benefit when using such
partitioning strategies.
