
As technology nodes continue to scale, main memories experience both increasing energy consumption as well as
reliability challenges. In order to address rising failure rates due
to problems with yield and runtime effects, such as crosstalk, due
to process variation in small feature sizes, improved correction
capabilities at the bit-level are increasingly essential. To address
this challenge, we propose a sustainable approach to error
correction in deeply scaled memories. In particular, we propose
a novel area-efficient and sustainable fault map (SFaultMap)
which targets holistic energy considerations to improve reliability
while minimizing both operational and embodied energy. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of SFaultMap we conduct a sustainability study, based on holistic energy consumption, to evaluate
under which scenarios different solutions should be employed.
In all cases and scenarios with moderate to high fault rates,
SFaultMap has reduced energy over Error Correcting Pointers
(ECP) for a five year lifetime. Moreover, as fault rate increases,
the indifference time for ECP to recover upfront manufacturing
energy increases from years to decades.
