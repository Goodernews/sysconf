simulation of an application execution in Clouds, still many researchers
argue that these results cannot be always generalized for complex application types, which consist of many dependencies among tasks and various scheduling possibilities, such as workflows. DynamicCloudSim, the
extension of the well known CloudSim simulator, offers users the capability to simulate the Cloud heterogeneity by introducing noisiness in
dozens parameters. Still, it is difficult, or sometimes even impossible to
determine appropriate values for all these parameters because they are
usually Cloud or application-dependent. In this paper, we propose a new
model that simplifies the simulation setup for a workflow and reduces
the bias between the behavior of simulated and real Cloud environments
based on one parameter only, the Cloud noisiness. It represents the noise
produced by the Cloud’s interference including the application’s (in our
case a workflow) noisiness too. Another novelty in our model is that it
does not use a normal distribution naively to create noised values, but
shifts the mean value of the task execution time by the cloud noisiness
and uses its deviation as a standard deviation. Besides our model reduces
the complexity of DynamicCloudSim’s heterogeneity model, evaluation
conducted in Amazon EC2 shows that it is also more accurate, with
better trueness (closeness to the real mean values) of up to 9.2% and
precision (closeness to the real deviation) of up to 8.39 times.
