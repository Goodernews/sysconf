
The power and procurement cost of bandwidth in
system-wide networks has forced a steady drop in the byte/flop
ratio. This trend of computation becoming faster relative to
the network is expected to hold. In this paper, we explore
how cost-oriented task placement enables reducing the cost
of system-wide networks by enabling high performance even
on tapered topologies where more bandwidth is provisioned
at lower levels. We describe APHiD, an efficient hierarchical
placement algorithm that uses new techniques to improve
the quality of heuristic solutions and reduces the demand on
high-level, expensive bandwidth in hierarchical topologies. We
apply APHID to a tapered fat-tree, demonstrating that APHiD
maintains application scalability even for severely tapered
network configurations. Using simulation, we show that for
tapered networks APHiD improves performance by more than
50% over random placement and even 15% in some cases over
costlier, state-of-the-art placement algorithms.
