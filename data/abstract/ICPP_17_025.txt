
As a fundamental cloud service for modern Web
applications, the cloud object storage system stores and retrieves millions or even billions of read-heavy data objects.
Serving for a massive amount of requests each day makes the
response latency be a vital component of user experiences. Due
to the lack of suitable understanding on the response latency
distribution, current practice is to use overprovision resources
to meet Service Level Agreement (SLA). Hence we build a
performance model for the cloud object storage system to predict the percentiles of requests meeting SLA (response latency
requirement), in the context of complicated disk operations
and event-driven programming model. Furthermore, we find
that the waiting time for being accept(-ed at storage servers
may introduce significant delay. And we quantify the impacts
on system response latency, due to requests waiting for being
accept()-ed. In a variety of scenarios, our model reduces the
prediction errors by up to 73% compared to baseline models,
and the prediction error of our model is 4.44% on average.
