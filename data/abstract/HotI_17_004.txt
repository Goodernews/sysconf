
Throughput performance, an important metric for
interconnection networks, is often quantified by the aggregate
throughput for a set of representative traffic patterns. A number of models have been developed to estimate the aggregate
throughput for a given traffic pattern on an interconnection
network. Since all of the models predict the same property
of interconnection networks, ideally, they should give similar
performance results or at least follow the same performance
trend. In this work, we examine four commonly used interconnect
throughput models and identify the cases when all models show
similar trends, when different models yield different trends, and
when different models produce contradictory results. Our study
reveals important properties of the models and demonstrates
the subtle differences among them, which are important for
an interconnect designer/researcher to understand, in order to
properly select a throughput model in the process of interconnect
evaluation.
