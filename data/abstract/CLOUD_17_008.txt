
A service-oriented architecture (SOA)-based application is composed of a number of distributed and looselycoupled services which are interconnected to accomplish a more
complex functionality. The main security challenge in SOA is
that we cannot trust the participating services in a service
composition to behave as expected all the time. Moreover, the
chain of all services involved in an end-to-end invocation may
not be visible to the clients. As a result, any violation of the
client’s policies could remain undetected. To address these
challenges in SOA, we propose the following contributions.
First, we propose a new end-to-end security architecture for
SOA based on a dynamic composite trust model. To maintain
the dynamic trust, we designed a trusted-third party service
called trust manager component, which collects and processes
feedbacks from the actual execution of services. Second, we
developed an end-to-end inter-service policy monitoring and
enforcement framework (PME framework), which is able
to dynamically intercept the interactions between services
at runtime and react to the potentially malicious activities
according to the client’s policies. Third, we design an intraservice policy monitoring and enforcement framework based
on taint analysis mechanism to monitor the flow of information
within services and detect and prevent information disclosure
attacks. These two frameworks together can provide an end-toend visibility and security in SOA. Finally, we have extensively
studied the correctness and performance of the proposed
security frameworks based on a realistic SOA case study in
a cloud environment. All experimental studies validate that
the practicality and effectiveness of the presented solutions.
