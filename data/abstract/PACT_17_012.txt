
 The looming breakdown of Moore’s Law and the
end of voltage scaling are ushering a new era where neither
transistors nor the energy to operate them is free. This calls for
a new regime in computer systems, one in which every transistor counts. Caches are essential for processor performance
and represent the bulk of modern processor’s transistor budget.
To get more performance out of the cache hierarchy, future
processors will rely on effective cache management policies.

This paper identifies variability in generational behavior of
cache blocks as a key challenge for cache management policies
that aim to identify dead blocks as early and as accurately as
possible to maximize cache efficiency. We show that existing
management policies are limited by the metrics they use to
identify dead blocks, leading to low coverage and/or low
accuracy in the face of variability. In response, we introduce
a new metric — Live Distance — that uses the stack distance to
learn the temporal reuse characteristics of cache blocks, thus
enabling a dead block predictor that is robust to variability in
generational behavior. Based on the reuse characteristics of an
application’s cache blocks, our predictor — Leeway - classifies
application’s behavior as streaming-oriented or reuse-oriented
and dynamically selects an appropriate cache management
policy. By leveraging live distance for LLC management,
Leeway outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on single- and
multi-core SPEC and manycore CloudSuite workloads.
