
We present and evaluate a new GPU algorithm
based on the Louvain method for community detection. Our
algorithm is the first for this problem that parallelizes the access
to individual edges. In this way we can fine tune the load balance
when processing networks with nodes of highly varying degrees.
This is achieved by scaling the number of threads assigned to
each node according to its degree. Extensive experiments show
that we obtain speedups up to a factor of 270 compared to
the sequential algorithm. The algorithm consistently outperforms
other recent shared memory implementations and is only one
order of magnitude slower than the current fastest parallel
Louvain method running on a Blue Gene/Q supercomputer using
more than 500K threads.
