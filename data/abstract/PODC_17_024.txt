recent years, distributed algorithm theorists have studied symmetry
breaking problems in models inspired by biology to help provide
insight into the capabilities and constraints of this natural process. A potential shortcoming of these models, however, is that
they execute distributed algorithms precisely as specified. In nature, where computation is often implemented by messy analog
systems, this precision cannot necessarily be guaranteed. Motivated
by this observation, in this paper we present a general method for
injecting “computational noise” into any distributed system model
that describes processes as interacting state machines. Our method
captures noise as a force that can cause state machines to transition
to the wrong state. We combine this formalization of noise with the
beeping models that have been a popular target of recent work on
bio-inspired symmetry breaking. We produce new upper and lower
bounds for both single hop and multihop models—studying leader
election in the former and the maximal independent set problem in
the latter. These bounds introduce new techniques for achieving
robustness to noise, and identify some fundamental limits in this
pursuit. We argue that both our general approach and specific results can help advance the productive relationship between biology
and algorithm theory.
