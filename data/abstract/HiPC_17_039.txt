
Approximate computing enables processing of
large-scale graphs by trading off quality for performance.
Approximate computing techniques have become critical not
only due to the emergence of parallel architectures but also due
to the availability of large scale datasets enabling data-driven
discovery. Using two prototypical graph algorithms, PageRank
and community detection, we present several approximate
computing heuristics to scale the performance with minimal
loss of accuracy. We present several heuristics including loop
perforation, data caching, incomplete graph coloring and
synchronization, and evaluate their efficiency. We demonstrate
performance improvements of up to 83% for PageRank and
up to 450x for community detection, with low impact on
accuracy for both the algorithms. We expect the proposed
approximate techniques will enable scalable graph analytics
on data of importance to several applications in science and
their subsequent adoption to scale similar graph algorithms.
