
Since main memory system contributes to a large
and increasing fraction of server/datacenter energy consumption,
there have been several efforts to reduce its power and energy
consumption. DVFS schemes have been used to reduce the
memory power, but they come with a performance penalty. In
this work, we propose DEMM, an OS-based, high performance
DVFS mechanism that reduces memory power by dynamically
scaling individual memory channel frequencies/voltages. Our
strategy also involves clustering the running applications based
on their sensitivities to memory latency, and assigning memory
channels to the application clusters. We introduce a new metric
called Discrete Misses per Kilo Cycle (DMPKC) to capture the
performance sensitivities of the applications to memory frequency
modulation. DEMM allows us to save power in the memory
system with negligible impact on performance. We demonstrate
around 25% savings in the memory system energy and 10%
savings in the total system energy, with only a 4% loss in
workload performance.
