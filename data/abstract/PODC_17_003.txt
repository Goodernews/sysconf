network in which different nodes can have access to different sets
of channels. By providing multiple channels, they improve the
efficiency and reliability of wireless communication. However, the
heterogeneous nature of cognitive radio networks also brings new
challenges to the design and analysis of distributed algorithms.

In this paper, we focus on two fundamental problems in cognitive radio networks: neighbor discovery, and global broadcast.
We consider a synchronous network containing n nodes, each of
which has access to c channels. We assume the network has diameter D, and each pair of neighbors have at least k > 1, and at
most Kkmax < c, shared channels. We also assume each node has at
most A neighbors. For the neighbor discovery problem, we design
a randomized algorithm called CSEEK which has time complexity
O((c?/k) + (kKmax /k)- A). CSEEK is flexible and robust, which allows
us to use it as a generic “filter” to find “well-connected” neighbors
with an even shorter running time. We then move on to the global
broadcast problem, and propose CGCastT, a randomized algorithm
which takes O((c?/k) + (kmax/k)- A + D- A) time. CGCast uses
CSEEK to achieve communication among neighbors, and uses edge
coloring to establish an efficient deterministic schedule for fast
message dissemination.

Towards the end of the paper, we give lower bounds for solving
the two problems. These lower bounds demonstrate that in many
cases CSEEK and CGCasT are near optimal.
