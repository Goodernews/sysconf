(DBP) problem, which extends the classical online bin packing
problem in that items arrive and depart over time and the departure
time of an item is known upon its arrival. The problem naturally
arises when handling cloud-based networks. We focus specifically
on the MinUsageTime cost function which aims to minimize the
overall usage time of all bins that are opened during the packing
og p

log log p
is defined as the ratio between the maximal and minimal durations

of all items. We improve the upper bound by giving an O(./log y)competitive algorithm. We then provide a matching lower bound
of Q(,/log yz) on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm, thus
closing the gap with regards to this problem. We then focus on
what we call the class of aligned inputs and give a O(log log :)competitive algorithm for this case, beating the lower bound of
the general case by an exponential factor. Surprisingly enough,
the analysis of our algorithm that we present, is closely related to
various properties of binary strings.
