
. Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) is a hardware/software
technique that enables the execution of multiple loop iterations in parallel, even in the presence of some loop-carried dependences. TLS requires
hardware mechanisms to support conflict detection, speculative storage,
in-order commit of transactions, and transaction roll-back. There is no
off-the-shelf processor that provides direct support for TLS. Speculative
execution is supported, however, in the form of Hardware Transactional
Memory (HTM)â€”available in recent processors such as the Intel Core
and the IBM POWERS. Earlier work has demonstrated that, in the
absence of specific TLS support in commodity processors, HTM support
can be used to implement TLS. This paper presents a careful evaluation
of the implementation of TLS on the HTM extensions available in such
machines. This evaluation provides evidence to support several important claims about the performance of TLS over HTM in the Intel Core
and the IBM POWERS8 architectures. Experimental results reveal that
by implementing TLS on top of HTM, speed-ups of up to 3.8x can be
obtained for some loops.
