
Energy efficiency is considered to be a critical
concern for modern hardware and a variety of hardware
features have been developed to improve the energy balance
for executing applications. This article focuses on the dynamic
voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) technique, which is available
for many platforms, including CPUs and GPUs. Analytical
models for capturing the energy efficiency are considered and
it is investigated whether such an analytical model is able to
support an a priori selection of the operational frequency that
leads to a near optimal energy consumption for the application
code to be executed. Also the energy-delay product (EDP) is
investigated, weighting the power against the square of execution
time. The experimental evaluation is performed on the basis
of the multi-threaded PARSEC benchmarks. We show that the
operational frequency selected according to the analytical models
leads to an energy consumption that is near the minimum energy
consumption over all frequencies available.
