important building block in High Performance Computing. Performance
improvements for the SpMV are often gained by the development of new
optimized sparse matrix formats either by utilizing special sparsity patterns of a matrix or by taking bottlenecks of a hardware architecture
into account. In this work a requirements analysis is done for sparse
matrix formats with an emphasis on the parallel SpMV for large general
sparse matrices. Based on these requirements, three new sparse matrix
formats were developed, each combining several optimization techniques
and addressing different optimization goals/hardware architectures. The
CSR5 Bit Compressed (CSR5BC) format is an extension to the existing
CSR5 format and optimized for GPUs. The other two formats, Hybrid
Compressed Slice Storage (HCSS) and Local Group Compressed Sparse
Row (LGCSR), are new formats optimized for multi-core/-processor
architectures including the Xeon Phi Knights Landing. Results show
that all three storage formats deliver good parallel SpMV performance
on their target architectures over a large set of test matrices compared
to other well performing formats in vendor and research libraries.
