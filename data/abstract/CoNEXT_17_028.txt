main technology proposed for TV white spaces is 802.11af, a Wi-Fi
variant adapted for TV frequencies. However, 802.11af is originally
designed for improved indoor propagation. We show that long links,
typical for outdoor use, exacerbate known Wi-Fi issues, such as
hidden and exposed terminal, and significantly reduce its efficiency.

Instead, we propose CellFi, an alternative architecture based
on LTE. LTE is designed for long-range coverage and throughput
efficiency, but it is also designed to operate in tightly controlled
and centrally managed networks. CellFi overcomes these problems
by designing an LTE-compatible spectrum database component,
mandatory for TV white space networking, and introducing an
interference management component for distributed coordination.
CellFi interference management is compatible with existing LTE
mechanisms, requires no explicit communication between base
stations, and is more efficient than CSMA for long links.

We evaluate our design through extensive real world evaluation
on off-the-shelf LTE equipment and simulations. We show that,
compared to 802.11af, it increases coverage by 40% and reduces
median flow completion times by 2.3x.
