
In recent years, fuzzy portfolio selection theory has
been well developed and widely applied. Based on the credibility
theory, several fuzzy portfolio selection models have been
proposed. The fuzzy Mean-CVaR portfolio model is one of the
state-of-the-art. However, itsâ€™ fuzzy nature which increases the
computational complexity makes it take a long time to solve. In
order to solve the fuzzy Mean-CVakR portfolio model efficiently, a
hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by integrating Genetic
Algorithm(GA) with adaptive penalty function, Simulated
Annealing Resilient Back Propagation (SARPROP) neural
network and fuzzy simulation techniques, and to accelerate the
computation speed further, we parallelize the hybrid intelligent
algorithm with MPI technology. In order to demonstrate its
validity and efficiency, we achieve numerical experiments on the
Era supercomputer, and the results are compared with the
method which is obtained by integrating traditional GA and fuzzy
simulation directly. The results show that hybrid intelligent
algorithm can get better performance. Experiments under
different processor cores also achieved on the Era supercomputer
demonstrate the scalability of the parallel hybrid intelligent
algorithm.
