
Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is necessary
for increasing the server utilization; however, it also leads to
VM performance degradation. This work presents a method
to predict the consolidated VMs performance from the critical
system events data. Experiments are designed to demonstrate
the effect of system events like interrupts, page faults, mutex
operations, and context switching on the consolidated VMs.
Results show that the host server counters are not reliable
for such predictions. On the other hand, the coupling of the
task execution time with the VM system events is an effective
way to predict the consolidation performance. Results further
show that the VM memory allocation plays an important part
in the consolidated tasks performance. The system event data
is also used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for
performance prediction on three hypervisors; ESXi, Xen, and
XenServer and similar results are observed in all three.
