as a crucial platform for deployment of various distributed applications. Many of these applications rely on data redundancy techniques, such as erasure coding, to achieve higher fault tolerance.
However, erasure coding applied in large scale overlay networks
entails various overheads in terms of storage, latency and data
rebuilding costs. These overheads are largely attributed to the
selected erasure coding scheme and the encoded chunk placement
in the overlay network. This paper explores a multi-objective
optimization approach for identifying appropriate erasure coding
schemes and encoded chunk placement in overlay networks. The
uniqueness of our approach lies in the consideration of multiple
erasure coding objectives such as encoding rate and redundancy
factor, with overlay network performance characteristics like
storage consumption, latency and system reliability. Our approach enables a variety of tradeoff solutions with respect to
these objectives to be identified in the form of a Pareto front.
To solve this problem, we propose a novel two stage multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, where the first stage determines
the optimal set of encoding schemes, while the second stage
optimizes placement of the corresponding encoded data chunks
in overlay networks of varying sizes. We study the performance
of our method by generating and analyzing the Pareto optimal
sets of tradeoff solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that
the Pareto optimal set produced by our multi-objective approach
includes and even dominates the chunk placements delivered by
a related state-of-the-art weighted sum method.
