
 Meeting the exponential increase in the global
demand for bandwidth has become a major concern for
today’s data centers. The scalability of any data center is
defined by the maximum capacity and port count of the
switching devices it employs, limited by total pin bandwidth on
current electronic switch ASICs. Optical switches can provide
higher capacity and port counts, and hence, can be used to
transform data center scalability. We have recently
demonstrated a 1000-port star-coupler based wavelength
division multiplexed (WDM) and time division multiplexed
(TDM) optical switch architecture offering a bandwidth of 32
Tbit/s with the use of fast wavelength-tunable transmitters and
high-sensitivity coherent receivers. However, the major
challenge in deploying such an optical switch to replace
current electronic switches lies in designing and implementing
a scalable scheduler capable of operating on packet timescales.

In this paper, we present a pipelined and highly parallel
electronic scheduler that configures the high-radix (1000-port)
optical packet switch. The scheduler can process requests from
1000 nodes and allocate timeslots across 320 wavelength
channels and 4000 wavelength-tunable transceivers within a
time constraint of lps. Using the Opencell NanGate 45nm
standard cell library, we show that the complete 1000-port
parallel scheduler algorithm occupies a circuit area of
52.7mm/’, 4-8x smaller than that of a high-performance switch
ASIC, with a clock period of less than 8ns, enabling 138
scheduling iterations to be performed in 1s. The performance
of the scheduling algorithm is evaluated in comparison to
maximal matching from graph theory and conventional
software-based wavelength allocation heuristics. The parallel
hardware scheduler is shown to achieve similar matching
performance and network throughput while being orders of
magnitude faster.
