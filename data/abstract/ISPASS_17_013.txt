
Presilicon simulation is one of the key toolsets for
computer architects to evaluate and optimize their future designs.
As Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the platform
of choice in many computing communities due to their impressive
processing capabilities, computer architecture researchers need a
simulation framework that allows them to quantitatively consider
design tradeoffs.

In this paper, we present the Multi2Sim Kepler simulator
framework, a new detailed GPU microarchitecture performance
simulator that supports NVIDIA’s Kepler shader assembly
(SASS) code execution. The toolset provides a disassembler, a
functional simulator and a detailed cycle-based simulator. We
provide insight into the architecture of the NVIDIA Kepler GPU,
describing the details of the streaming multiprocessor, front-end
and instruction pipelines. We compare the performance of this
new simulator against an NVIDIA K20X, a high-end Kepler
device. We also evaluate the performance of NVIDIA’s CUDA
benchmark suite on our GPU performance simulator.
