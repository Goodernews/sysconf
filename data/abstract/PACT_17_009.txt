
Karly design space evaluation of computer systems
is usually performed using performance models (e.g., detailed
simulators, RTL-based models, etc.). However, it is very challenging (often impossible) to run many emerging applications on
detailed performance models owing to their complex softwarestacks and long run times. To overcome such challenges in
benchmarking these complex applications, we propose a proxy
generation methodology, PerfProx to generate miniature proxy
benchmarks, which are representative of the performance of realworld applications and yet, converge to results quickly and do not
need any complex software-stack support. Past proxy generation
research utilizes detailed micro-architecture independent metrics
derived from detailed simulators, which are often difficult to
generate for many emerging applications. PerfProx enables fast
and efficient proxy generation using performance metrics derived
primarily from hardware performance counters. We evaluate
the proxy generation framework on three modern databases
(Cassandra, MongoDB and MySQL) running data-serving and
data-analytics applications. The proxy benchmarks mimic the
performance (IPC) of the original applications with ~94%
accuracy, while significantly reducing the instruction count.
