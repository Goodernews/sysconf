
The task-to-core scheduling problem using
Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) for achieving
three objectives of performance, energy, and temperature (PET),
poses algorithmic challenges as it involves conflicting goals and
trade-offs. Some myriad static algorithms have been proposed for
solving this problem which can be roughly categorized into three
groups: approaches for generating optimal solutions (for smaller
sizes problems), complex optimization techniques, and fast
heuristics. These algorithms generate multi-dimensional results
which can be hardly intelligible. The assessment of these results
requires new comparison methods and concise evaluation
measures. This paper proposes a set of benchmarks and
evaluation procedures for carrying out methodical comparisons
of various algorithms for solving the PET-aware task-to-core
scheduling problem. The proposed performance measures assist
in judiciously comparing these different algorithms and
analyzing their results on a unified basis. The goal is also to seek
answers as to how good the Pareto-optimal algorithms are
compared to fast heuristics tackling the same problem with the
same assumptions. At the same time, we are interested in
knowing how good both the groups of algorithms are compared
to the absolute optimal (at least for small sets of problems). In
addition, the paper provides methods for evaluating trade-offs
and determining which application and target parameters affect
the results (performance, energy consumed and temperature
achieved) of these algorithms. Extensive experimentations
facilitate a comprehensive comparison of different kinds of
algorithms amongst themselves as well as with optimal solutions
obtained through Integer Linear Programming as a reference.
