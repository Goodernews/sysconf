
 The overwhelming wealth of parallelism exposed
by Extreme-scale computing is rekindling the interest for finegrain multithreading, particularly at the intranode level. Indeed, popular parallel programming models, such as OpenMP,
are integrating fine-grain tasking in their newest standards.
Yet, classical coarse-grain constructs are still largely preferred,
as they are considered simpler to express parallelism. In
this paper, we present a Multigrain Parallel Programming
environment that allows programmers to use these well-known
coarse-grain constructs to generate a fine-grain multithreaded
application to be run on top of a fine-grain event-driven program execution model. Experimental results with four scientific
benchmarks (Graph500, NAS Data Cube, NWChem-SCF, and
ExMatExâ€™s CoMD) show that fine-grain applications generated
by and run on our environment are competitive and even
outperform their OpenMP counterparts, especially for dataintensive workloads with irregular and dynamic parallelism,
reaching speedups as high as 2.6x for Graph500 and 50x for
NAS Data Cube.
