
 Composite Cores Architecture (CCA), a class of
dynamic heterogeneous architectures, enables the system to
construct the right core at run-time for each application by
composing cores together to build larger core or decomposing a
large core into multiple smaller cores. While this architecture
provides more flexibility for the running application to find the
best run-time settings to maximize energy-efficiency, due to
interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the type of
the core, run-time voltage and frequency and the number of
threads, it makes it more challenging for scheduling. Past
research mainly addressed the scheduling problem in composite
cores architecture by looking at one or two of these tuning
parameters. However, as we will show in this paper, it is
important to concurrently optimize and fine-tune these
parameters to harness the power of heterogeneity in this
emerging class of architecture. In addition, most previous work
on CCA mainly studied traditional single threaded CPU
applications. In this work, we investigate the scheduling
challenges for multithreaded applications in CCA. First, through
methodical investigation of power and performance results, we
characterize various multithreaded applications on a CCA which
can be composed into few big or many little cores and
demonstrate how the interplay among various application,
system, and architecture level parameters affect the performance
and energy-efficiency. Furthermore, based on characterization
results, a highly accurate regression-based model for energyefficiency prediction is developed to guide the scheduling
decision. Using the predictive model, we developed a scheduling
scheme for effective mapping of multithreaded applications onto
CCA. The results show that the proposed scheduling scheme on
average achieves close to 94% efficiency as compared to the
Oracle scheduling.
