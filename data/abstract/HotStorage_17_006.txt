crash. However, there is little infrastructure for systematically testing crash consistency in file systems. We
introduce CrashMonkey, a simple, flexible, file-systemagnostic test framework to systematically check file systems for inconsistencies if a failure occurs during a filesystem operation. CrashMonkey is modular and flexible,
allowing the users to easily specify different test workloads and custom consistency checks.
