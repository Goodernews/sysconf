
Today’s cloud services extensively rely on replication techniques to ensure availability and reliability. In
complex datacenter network architectures, however, seemingly independent replica servers may inadvertently
share deep dependencies (e.g., aggregation switches). Such unexpected common dependencies may potentially
result in correlated failures across the entire replication deployments, invalidating the efforts. Although
existing cloud management and diagnosis tools have been able to offer post-failure forensics, they, nevertheless,
typically lead to quite prolonged failure recovery time in the cloud-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a
novel language framework, named RepAudit, that manages to prevent correlated failure risks before service
outages occur, by allowing cloud administrators to proactively audit the replication deployments of interest.
In particular, RepAudit consists of three new components: 1) a declarative domain-specific language, RAL, for
cloud administrators to write auditing programs expressing diverse auditing tasks; 2) a high-performance
RAL auditing engine that generates the auditing results by accurately and efficiently analyzing the underlying
structures of the target replication deployments; and 3) an RAL-code generator that can automatically produce
complex RAL programs based on easily written specifications. Our evaluation result shows that RepAudit
uses 80× less lines of code than state-of-the-art efforts in expressing the auditing task of determining the
top-20 critical correlated-failure root causes. To the best of our knowledge, RepAudit is the first effort capable
of simultaneously offering expressive, accurate and efficient correlated failure auditing to the cloud-scale
replication systems.
