
In today’s multicore systems, depending on an
application’s computational demand, cores are either operated
individually at different Voltage/Frequency (V/F) levels or
grouped into multiple Voltage-Frequency Islands (VFIs) to
reduce system energy consumption. This paper formulates a
task scheduling and VFI partitioning problem whose
optimization goal is to minimize the task set (application)
execution time (makespan) for a given energy budget. First, the
combinatorial optimization problem is formulated with Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) to obtain per-core, per-task
dynamic V/F levels in a fine-grain VFI-based system with
single-core islands. Next, static task scheduling on coarse-grain
VFI-based systems, where an island can contain several cores
operated at the same V/F level, is formulated with Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP), considering the energy
budget and task set’s precedence constraints. The experimental
results show that under different energy budget constraints,
fine-grain, dynamic task allocations provide on average 1.35x
speedup over static coarse grain scheduling and partitioning
methods.
