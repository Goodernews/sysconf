costs for both storing and communicating data, even after
using techniques such as chunk-based deduplication and
delta compression. The current trend of providing access
to past versions of data exacerbates both costs.

In this paper, we show that deterministic recomputation of data can substantially reduce the cost of cloud
storage. Borrowing a well-known dualism from the faulttolerance community, we note that any data can be equivalently represented by a log of the nondeterministic inputs needed to produce that data. We design a file system, called Knockoff, that selectively substitutes nondeterministic inputs for file data to reduce communication
and storage costs. Knockoff compresses both data and
computation logs: it uses chunk-based deduplication for
file data and delta compression for logs of nondeterminism. In two studies, Knockoff reduces the average cost
of sending files to the cloud without versioning by 21%
and 24%; the relative benefit increases as versions are
retained more frequently.
