situational-awareness though real-time information, such as video
content, for natural disaster management. The video content
can be generated by surveillance cameras or crowd-sourced
(e.g., using smart-phones) and live-streamed to the Incident
Commander. Such video contents need to be processed to adapt
the characteristics of the specialized multi-view display devices.
When a disaster occurs, there is a surge in the number of videos
streamed to the Incident Commander that oversubscribes the
processing servers and the network load. Incident Commanders,
however, need a smooth and uninterrupted viewing experience
specifically for the important events of interest that can change
over time. The challenge is how to enable the Incident Commander to interactively prioritize important video streams to receive
them uninterruptedly while the system is oversubscribed. In such
a system, normal video streams (i.Â¢., non-prioritized ones) should
not be interrupted at the expense of prioritization. To address
this challenge, in this research, we propose a stream-priority
aware resource allocation mechanism to enable interactive video
prioritization without a major impact on the flow of nonprioritized video streams. The mechanism includes a method to
select appropriate tasks from the arriving ones and a method
to map the selected task to the appropriate video server. Our
simulation results express that the percentage of normal and
prioritized video streaming tasks that have completed on-time
are improved, when compared with baseline scheduling methods.
