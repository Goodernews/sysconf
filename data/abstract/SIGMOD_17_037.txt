data is to determine if there is a path in the graph from
a given source vertex to a given target vertex, using only
edges with labels in a restricted subset of the edge labels
in the graph. Such label-constrained reachability (LCR)
queries play an important role in graph analytics, for example, as a core fragment of the so-called regular path queries
which are supported in practical graph query languages such
as the W3C’s SPARQL 1.1, Neo4j’s Cypher, and Oracle’s
PGQL. Current solutions for LCR evaluation, however, do
not scale to large graphs which are increasingly common
in a broad range of application domains. In this paper we
present the first practical solution for efficient LCR evaluation, leveraging landmark-based indexes for large graphs.
We show through extensive experiments that our indexes
are significantly smaller than state-of-the-art LCR indexing techniques, while supporting up to orders of magnitude
faster query evaluation times. Our complete C++ codebase
is available as open source for further research.
