
Mobile apps have to satisfy various privacy requirements. Notably, app publishers are often obligated to provide a
privacy policy and notify users of their apps’ privacy practices.
But how can a user tell whether an app behaves as its policy
promises? In this study we introduce a scalable system to help
analyze and predict Android apps’ compliance with privacy
requirements. We discuss how we customized our system in a
collaboration with the California Office of the Attorney General.
Beyond its use by regulators and activists our system is also meant
to assist app publishers and app store owners in their internal
assessments of privacy requirement compliance.

Our analysis of 17,991 free Android apps shows the viability
of combining machine learning-based privacy policy analysis with
static code analysis of apps. Results suggest that 71% of apps that
lack a privacy policy should have one. Also, for 9,050 apps that
have a policy, we find many instances of potential inconsistencies
between what the app policy seems to state and what the code
of the app appears to do. In particular, as many as 41% of
these apps could be collecting location information and 17%
could be sharing such with third parties without disclosing so in
their policies. Overall, each app exhibits a mean of 1.83 potential
privacy requirement inconsistencies.
