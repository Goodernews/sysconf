to move computational tasks from cloud structures to multiple
devices close to the end user. An example for this are embedded systems in autonomous cars that communicate in order to coordinate
their actions.

Our model is a variant of the classical Page Migration Problem.
More formally, we consider a mobile server holding a data page. The
server can move in the Euclidean space (of arbitrary dimension).
In every round, requests for data items from the page pop up at
arbitrary points in the space. The requests are served, each at a cost
of the distance from the requesting point and the server, and the
mobile server may move, at a cost D times the distance traveled for
some constant D. We assume a maximum distance m the server is
allowed to move per round.

We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive
ratio independent of the length of the input sequence in this setting.
Hence we augment the maximum movement distance of the online
algorithms to (1 + 6) times the maximum distance of the offline
solution. We provide a deterministic algorithm which is simple
to describe and works for multiple variants of our problem. The
algorithm achieves almost tight competitive ratios independent of
the length of the input sequence.
