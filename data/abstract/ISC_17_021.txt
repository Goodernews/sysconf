
. The power scaling challenge associated with Exascale systems is a well-known issue. In this work, we introduce the Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM): a tree-hierarchical, open source
runtime framework we are contributing to the HPC community to foster increased collaboration and accelerated progress toward softwarehardware co-designed energy management solutions that address Exascale power challenges and improve performance and energy efficiency
in current systems. Through its plugin extensible architecture, GEOPM
enables rapid prototyping of new energy management strategies. Different plugins can be tailored to the specific performance or energy efficiency priorities of each HPC center. To demonstrate the potential of
the framework, this work develops an example plugin for GEOPM. This
power rebalancing plugin targets power-capped systems and improves
efficiency by minimizing job time-to-solution within a power budget. Our
results demonstrate up to 30% improvements in the time-to-solution of
CORAL system procurement benchmarks on a Xeon Phi cluster.
