at the rack-scale, offers the opportunity to use valuable
resources more efficiently. It is common that mass storage racks in large-scale clouds are filled with servers with
Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) attached directly to each of
them, either using SATA or SAS depending on the number of HDDs.

What does disaggregated storage mean for these
racks? We define four categories of in-rack disaggregation: complete, dynamic elastic, failure, and configuration disaggregation. We explore the benefits and impact of these design points by building a highly flexible
research storage fabric, that allows us to build example
systems that embody the four designs.
