
High end scientific applications in the form of workflows are
being executed in cloud for various benefits. But with an increase in the
processing capabilities of the cloud system, the energy consumption has also
increased significantly. Thus energy efficient execution of these scientific
workflows in cloud becomes essential. Existing research on energy efficient
scheduling of scientific workflows in cloud mainly focus on reducing only
the dynamic energy consumption of the compute nodes and uses DVFS
technique.

In this paper, we have proposed six different energy efficient scheduling
approaches for a set of online scientific workflows in a cloud system
considering both static and dynamic energy consumption of the compute
nodes. These approaches are divided into two categories: non-splittable
allocation of VMs on single host, and splittable allocation on multiple hosts.
‘We have compared the performance of our proposed policies with state-ofart energy efficient scheduling policy, EnReal and found that the policies
perform better than EnReal. All three scheduling policies with non-splittable
‘VM allocation perform at par with EnReal in energy consumption but they
do not require any migration of VMs. And all policies under splittable VM
category perform significantly better than EnReal with an average energy
reduction of 70%.
