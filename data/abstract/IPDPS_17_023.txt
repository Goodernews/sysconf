
One-Way Wave Equation Migration (QWEM) is a
depth migration algorithm used for seismic imaging. A parallel
version of this algorithm is widely implemented using MPI.
Heterogenous architectures that use GPUs have become popular
in the Top 500 because of their performance/power ratio. In this
paper, we discuss the methodology and code transformations used
to port OWEM to GPUs using OpenACC, along with the code
changes needed for scaling the application up to 18,400 GPUs
(more than 98%) of the Titan leadership class supercomputer at
Oak Ridget National Laboratory. For the individual OpenACC
kernels, we achieved an average of 3X speedup on a test dataset
using one GPU as compared with an 8-core Intel Sandy Bridge
CPU. The application was then run at large scale on the Titan
supercomputer achieving a peak of 1.2 petaflops using an average
of 5.5 megawatts. After porting the application to GPUs, we
discuss how we dealt with other challenges of running at scale
such as the application becoming more I/O bound and prone to
silent errors. We believe this work will serve as valuable proof
that directive-based programming models are a viable option for
scaling HPC applications to heterogenous architectures.
