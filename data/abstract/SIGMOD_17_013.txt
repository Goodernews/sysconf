
In Entity Resolution, the objective is to find which records
of a dataset refer to the same real-world entity. Crowd Entity Resolution uses humans, in addition to machine algorithms, to improve the quality of the outcome. We study an
approach that combines two common interfaces for human
tasks in Crowd Entity Resolution, taking into account some
key observations about the advantages and disadvantages
of the two interfaces. We give a formal definition to the
problem of human tasksâ€™ selection and we derive algorithms
with strong optimality guarantees. Our experiments with
three real-world datasets show that our approach gives an
improvement of 50% to 300% in the crowd cost to resolve a
dataset, compared to using only tasks of the same interface.
