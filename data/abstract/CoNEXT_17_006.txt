(mm-wave) communication systems requires efficient beam-steering
algorithms. To find the optimal steering direction on IEEE 802.11ad
compatible devices, state-of-the-art approaches sweep through all
predefined antenna sectors. Recently, much more efficient alternatives, such as compressive path tracking, have been proposed,
which scale well even with arrays with thousands of antenna elements. However, such have not yet been integrated into consumer
devices. In this work, we adapt compressive path tracking for sector selection in off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. In contrast to
existing solutions, our compressive sector selection tolerates the
imperfections of low-cost hardware, tracks beam directions in 3D
and does not rely on pseudo-random beams. We implement our
protocol on a commodity router, the TP-Link Talon AD7200, by
modifying the sector sweep algorithm in the IEEE 802.11ad chip’s
firmware. In particular, we modify the firmware to obtain the signal
strength of received frames and to select custom sectors. Using
this extension, we precisely measure the device’s sector patterns.
We then select the best sector based on the measured patterns and
sweep only through a subset of probing sectors. Our results demonstrate, that our protocol outperforms the existing sector sweep,
increases stability, and speeds up the sector selection by factor 2.3.
