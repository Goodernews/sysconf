translation layer for shingled magnetic recording (SMR)
drives. Data is written in-place by caching data from the next
track in the shingling direction, allowing direct overwrite
of sectors in the target track. This enables Vguard to take
advantage of track-level locality, nearly eliminating cleaning
for many workloads. We compare performance of Vguard
to an available drive-managed SMR drive analyzed and
modeled in previous research. Vguard reduces the 99.9%
latency by 15x for real-world traces, and maximum latency
by 32% for synthetic random write workloads.
