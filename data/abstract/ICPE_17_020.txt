the expected lifespan. This work is dedicated to examining
the practical implication of the four existing analytical models for estimating the write amplification: Coupon Collector,
Uniform Distribution, Expected Value and Markov model.
Since the models assume uniform random workload in full
utilization of an SSD to predict write amplification, they are
not applicable in predicting write amplification in general
workload. Moreover, the existing models have not been verified with the real SSD. In this work, we compare the write
amplification of the models with that of a real SSD. When
we use 0.147 as the overprovisioning factor of an SSD while
running uniform random workload, the write amplification
of Uniform Distribution, Expected Value, Markov model is
3.90, 4.08, and 4.08, respectively. However, write amplification of the real SSD shows 1.19, which is very different
from that of the prediction models. Through experiment,
we found that write amplification is closely related to the
value of overprovisioning factor. To improve the accuracy
of existing prediction models, we update the overprovisioning factor to take account of the ratio of a hot file and the
utilization of the storage. We also find that by setting the
overprovisioning factor to 1.15, we can obtain write amplification of 1.2 which is close to the write amplification of
general workload in a real SSD.
