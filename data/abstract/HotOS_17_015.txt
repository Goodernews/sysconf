process that ensures quantitative stochastic requirements like
requirements on the expected energy consumption or resilience
requirements by construction. The idea is to automatically extract a formal model from a configurable system and to use
formal analysis techniques to automatically determine a configuration such that the system meets the quantitative requirements. As a proof of concept we present a tool that supports
the automated synthesis of protocol parameters for IPC (interprocess communication). The tool takes as input a Lua script
describing the communication structure of several processes.
This script is annotated with quantitative information such
as error probabilities and timing information. The output is a
Markov chain specified in the input language of the prominent
probabilistic model checker PRISM. This Markov chain yields
the basis for quantitative formal analysis of failure scenarios
caused by hardware faults in IPC channels. The results yield
the basis for finding optimal values for protocol parameters
that tune, e.g., the level of resiliency. As an initial demonstration of the tool, we analyze and adjust system parameters of
a simple scenario with a few communicating processes and

report on results. Though achieved under simplified assumptions, the results presented here are a proof-of-concept towards
the vision of automated system configuration.
