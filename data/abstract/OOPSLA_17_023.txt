
This paper presents GLORE, a novel approach to enabling the detection and removal of large-scope redundant
computations in nested loops. GLORE works on LER-notation, a new representation of computations in both
regular and irregular loops. Together with a set of novel algorithms, it makes GLORE able to systematically
consider computation reordering at both the expression level and the loop level in a unified manner. GLORE
shows an applicability much broader than prior methods have, and frequently lowers the computational
complexities of some nested loops that are elusive to prior optimization techniques, producing significantly
larger speedups.
