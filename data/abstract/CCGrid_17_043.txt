
The management of complex network services requires flexible and efficient service provisioning as well as
optimized handling of continuous changes in the workload
of the services. To adapt to changes in the demand, service
components need to be replicated (scaling) and allocated to
physical resources (placement) dynamically. In this paper, we
propose a fully automated approach to the joint optimization
problem of scaling and placement, enabling quick reaction to
changes. We formalize the problem, analyze its complexity, and
develop two algorithms to solve it. Empirical results show the
applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
