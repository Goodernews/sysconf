
With current DRAM technology reaching its limit,
emerging heterogeneous memory systems have become attractive to continue scaling memory performance. This paper
argues for using a small, fast memory closer to the processor
as part of a flat address space where the memory system
is composed of two or more memory types. OS-transparent
management of such memory has been proposed in prior works
such as CAMEO and Part of Memory (PoM). Data migration
is typically handled either at coarse granularity with high
bandwidth overheads (as in PoM) or at fine granularity with
low hit rate (as in CAMEO). Prior work uses restricted address
mapping from only congruence groups in order to simplify the
mapping. At any time, only one page (block) from a congruence
group is resident in the fast memory.

In this paper, we present a flat address space organization
called SILC-FM that uses large granularity but allows subblocks from two pages to coexist in an interleaved fashion in
fast memory. Data movement is done at subblocked granularity,
avoiding fetching of useless subblocks and consuming less
bandwidth compared to migrating the entire large block.
SILC-FM can achieve more spatial locality hits than CAMEO
and PoM due to page-level operation and interleaving blocks
respectively. The interleaved subblock placement improves
performance by 55% on average over a static placement scheme
without data migration. We also selectively lock hot blocks
to prevent them from being involved in hardware swapping
operations. Additional features such as locking, associativity
and bandwidth balancing improve performance by 11%, 8%,
and 8% respectively, resulting in a total of 82% performance
improvement over a no migration static placement scheme.
Compared to the best state-of-the-art scheme, SILC-FM gets
performance improvement of 36% with 13% energy savings.
