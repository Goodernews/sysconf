ciplines, ranging from collaborative teams, crowdsourcing, au- wi ei asec
tonomous systems to networked systems. From the algorithmic BD 02 ;
perspective, the existing work has primarily focused on predicting g miLassow! Ractpartinieependency
the outcomes of the whole and parts, by either separate models eB‚Äù ~
or linear joint models, which assume the outcome of the parts has F oa
a linear and independent effect on the outcome of the whole. In s ~ .
this paper, we propose a joint predictive method named PAROLE B (0.05 L - ~
to simultaneously and mutually predict the part and whole out- g L

comes. The proposed method offers two distinct advantages over
the existing work. First (Model Generality), we formulate joint
PART-WHOLE outcome prediction as a generic optimization problem, which is able to encode a variety of complex relationships
between the outcome of the whole and parts, beyond the linear
independence assumption. Second (Algorithm Efficacy), we propose an effective and efficient block coordinate descent algorithm,
which is able to find the coordinate-wise optimum with a linear
complexity in both time and space. Extensive empirical evaluations
on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed PAROLE (1)
leads to consistent prediction performance improvement by modeling the non-linear part-whole relationship as well as part-part
interdependency, and (2) scales linearly in terms of the size of the
training dataset.
