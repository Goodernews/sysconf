allocation designed to take into account both consumers and
providers’ interests. This comes in contrast to today’s providercentered models that subject users to more restrictive terms and
conditions. Both parties’ interests are computed in the form of
integer constraints. Costs and availability are embedded as key
objectives and performance criteria in the model. We propose
a hybrid resolution method based on an evolutionary algorithm
augmented with a tabu search and compare performance with
other resource allocation algorithms. The comparison results reveal the efficiency of the proposed hybrid evolutionary algorithms
for consumer and provider centric cloud resources allocation.
