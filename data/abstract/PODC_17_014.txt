
Computing a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) is a central problem
in distributed graph algorithms. This paper presents an improved
randomized distributed algorithm for computing an MIS in an allto-all communication distributed model, known as the congested
clique model, defined as follows: Given a graph G = (V, £), initially
each node knows only its neighbors. Communication happens in
synchronous rounds over a complete graph, and per round each
node can send O(log n) bits to each other node.

We present a randomized algorithm that computes an MIS in
O(log A/,/logn +1) < O(,flog A) rounds of congested clique, with
high probability. Here A denotes the maximum degree in the graph.
This improves quadratically on the O(log A) algorithm of [Ghaffari,
SODA’16]. The core technical novelty in this result is a certain
local sparsification technique for MIS, which we believe to be of
independent interest.
