global event-participant arrangement strategies for EBSNs
are becoming popular recently. Existing works measure satisfaction of an arrangement by a linear combination of few
factors, weights of which are predefined and fixed, and do
not allow users to provide feedbacks on whether accepting
the arrangement or not. Besides, most of them only consider
offline scenarios, where full information of users is known in
advance. However, on real-world EBSN platforms, users can
dynamically log in the platform and register for events on
a first come, first served basis. In other words, online scenarios of event-participant arrangement strategies should be
considered. In this work, we study a new event-participant
arrangement strategy for online scenarios, the FeedbackAware Social Event-participant Arrangement (FASEA) problem, where satisfaction scores of an arrangement are learned
adaptively and users can choose to accept or reject the arranged events. Particularly, we model the problem as a contextual combinatorial bandit setting and use efficient and
effective algorithms to solve the problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the solutions are evaluated with extensive experimental studies and our findings indicate that
the state-of-the-art Thompson Sampling that is reported to
work well under basic multi-armed bandit does not perform
well under FASEA.
