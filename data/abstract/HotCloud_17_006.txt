
The performance of mobile phone processors has been
steadily increasing, causing the performance gap between server and mobile processors to narrow with mobile processors sporting superior performance per unit
energy. Fueled by the slowing of Mooreâ€™s Law, the overall performance of single-chip mobile and server processors have likewise plateaued. These trends and the glut
of used and partially broken smartphones which become
environmental e-waste motivate creating cloud servers
out of decommissioned mobile phones. This work proposes creating a compute dense server built out of used
and partially broken smartphones (e.g. screen can be broken). This work evaluates the total cost of ownership
(TCO) benefit of using servers based on decommissioned
mobile devices and analyzes some of the architectural
design trade-offs in creating such servers.
