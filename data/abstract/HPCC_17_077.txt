
Internet of Things (IoT), one of the key elements
of a smart factory, is dubbed as Industrial IoT (IloT). Software
defined networking is a technique that benefits network management in IIoT applications by providing network reconfigurability.
In this way, controllers are integrated within the network
to advertise routing rules dynamically based on network and
link changes. We consider controllers within Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) for IloT applications in such a way to provide
reliability and timeliness. Network reliability is addressed for the
case of node failure by considering multiple sinks and multiple
controllers. Real-time requirements are implicitly applied by
limiting the number of hops (maximum path-length) between
sensors and sinks/controllers, and by confining the maximum
workload on each sink/controller. Deployment planning of sinks
should ensure that when a sink or controller fails, the network
is still connected. In this paper, we target the challenge of
placement of multiple sinks and controllers, while ensuring that
each sensor node is covered by multiple sinks (k sinks) and
multiple controllers (â€™ controllers). We evaluate the proposed
algorithm using the benchmark GRASP-MSP through extensive
experiments, and show that our approach outperforms the
benchmark by lowering the total deployment cost by up to
24%. The reduction of the total deployment cost is fulfilled not
only as the result of decreasing the number of required sinks
and controllers but also selecting cost-effective sinks/controllers
among all candidate sinks/controllers.
