
We are now developing a manycore-aware implementation of multiprocessed PIC (particle-in-cell) simulation
code with automatic load balancing. A key issue of the
implementation is how to exploit the wide SIMD mechanism
of manycore processors such as Intel Xeon Phi. Our solution is
particle binning to rank all particles in a cell (voxel) in a chunk
of SOA (structure-of-arrays) type one-dimensional arrays so
that particle-push and current-scatter operations on them are
efficiently SIMD-vectorized by our compiler. In addition, our
sophisticated binning mechanism performs sorting of particles
according to their positions on-the-fly, efficiently coping with
occasional bin overflow in a fully multithreaded manner. Our
performance evaluation with up to 64 nodes of Cray XC30
and XC40 supercomputers, equipped with Xeon Phi 5120D
(Knights Corner) and 7250 (Knights Landing) respectively, not
only exhibited good parallel performance, but also proved the
effectiveness of our binning mechanism.
