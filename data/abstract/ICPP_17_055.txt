
Energy consumption has become a major concern
in the recent years and Green computing has arisen as one of the
challenges in order to reduce CO2 emissions in the computing
domain. Many efforts have been made to make hardware less
energy consuming, reduce cooling energy of data and computing
centers by relocating those facilities to cool regions and other. A
novel approach to make the computing domain greener is to add
renewable energy sources for the power supply. The challenge
of this work is to consider computing facilities which are solely
run by renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind
turbines. In this work we tackle the problem of scheduling
independent tasks within a predicted power envelope that varies
during the time. First we evaluate different instances of the
problem from a theoretical point of view. Then we propose several
heuristics for the case of multi-core architectures and we assess
their performance on synthetic workloads and power envelopes.
