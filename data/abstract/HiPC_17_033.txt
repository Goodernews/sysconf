
In this paper, we combine high-performance computing science with computational neuroscience methods to
show how to speed-up cutting-edge methods for mapping and
evaluation of the large-scale network of brain connections. More
specifically, we use a recent factorization method of the Linear
Fascicle Evaluation model (i.e., LiFE [1], [2]) that allows for
statistical evaluation of brain connectomes. The method called
ENCODE [3], [4] uses a Sparse Tucker Decomposition approach
to represent the LiFE model. We show that we can implement
the optimization step of the ENCODE method using MPI and
OpenMP programming paradigms. Our approach involves the
parallelization of the multiplication step of the ENCODE method.
We model our design theoretically and demonstrate empirically
that the design can be used to identify optimal configurations for
the LiFE model optimization via ENCODE method on different
hardware platforms. In addition, we co-design the MPI runtime
with the LiFE model to achieve profound speed-ups. Extensive
evaluation of our designs on multiple clusters corroborates our
theoretical model. We show that on a single node on TACC
Stampede2, we can achieve speed-ups of up to 8.7x as compared
to the original approach.
