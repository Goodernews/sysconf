
We study (deterministic) leader election in
unidirectional rings of homonym processes that have
no a priori knowledge on the number of processes. In
this context, we show that there is no algorithm that
solves process-terminating leader election for the class
of asymmetric labeled rings. In particular, there is no
process-terminating leader election algorithm in rings in
which at least one label is unique. However, we show
that process-terminating leader election is possible for
the subclass of asymmetric rings, where multiplicity is
bounded. We confirm this positive results by proposing two
algorithms, which achieve the classical trade-off between
time and space.
