
With the development of cloud computing, disk
arrays tolerating triple disk failures (3DFTs) are receiving more
attention nowadays because they can provide high data reliability
with low monetary cost. However, a challenging issue in these
arrays is how to efficiently reconstruct the lost data, especially
for partial stripe errors (e.g., sector and chunk errors). It is one
of the most significant scenarios in practice. However, existing
cache strategies are not efficient for partial stripe reconstruction
in 3DFTs, which is because the complex relationships among data
and parities are usually ignored during the recovery process.

To address this problem, in this paper, we proposed a comprehensive cache policy called Favorable Block First (FBF), which
can speed up the partial stripe reconstruction of 3DFTs. FBF
investigates the relationships among parity chains via allocating
various priorities of shared chunks. Thus in the recovery process,
by giving higher priorities to the chunks which are shared by
more parities chains, FBF can dynamically hold the significant
data in buffer cache for partial stripe reconstruction. Obviously,
it increases the cache hit ratio and reduces the reconstruction
time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FBF, we conduct several
simulations via Disksim. The results show that, compared to
typical recovery schemes by combining with classic cache policies
(e.g., LRU, LFU and ARC), FBF improves hit ratio by up to
2.47x and accelerates the reconstruction process by 14.90%,
respectively.
