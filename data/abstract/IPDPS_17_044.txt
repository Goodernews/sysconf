
On most supercomputers, except some torus network based systems, resource managers allocate nodes to jobs
without considering the sharing of network resources by different
jobs. Such network-oblivious resource allocations result in link
sharing among multiple jobs that can cause significant performance variability and performance degradation for individual
jobs. In this paper, we explore low-diameter networks and
corresponding node allocation policies that can eliminate interjob interference. We propose a variation to n-dimensional mesh
networks called express mesh. An express mesh is denser than the
corresponding mesh network, has a low diameter independent of
the number of routers, and is easily partitionable. We compare
structural properties and performance of express mesh with
other popular low-diameter networks. We present practical node
allocation policies for express mesh and fat-tree networks that not
only eliminate inter-job interference and performance variability,
but also improve overall performance.
