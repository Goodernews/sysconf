heterogeneous contributing to higher performance and power
efficiency. However, this is at the cost of increasing the overall
complexity of designing such systems. One key challenge in the
design of heterogeneous systems is the efficient scheduling of
computational load. To address this challenge, this paper thoroughly
analyzes state of the art scheduling policies and proposes a new
dynamic scheduling heuristic: Alternative Processor within
Threshold (APT). This heuristic uses a flexibility factor to attain
efficient usage of the available hardware resources, taking
advantage of the degree of heterogeneity of the system. In a GPUCPU-FPGA system, tested on workloads with and without data
dependencies, this approach improved overall execution time by
16% and 18% when compared to the second best heuristic.
