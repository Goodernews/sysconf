
Platform as a Service (PaaS) clouds provide part
of the hardware/software stack and related services to tenant
applications. Increased load is handled elastically by scaling,
which either modifies the number of instances an application
has available on the cloud or increases their available resources.
However, because all these instances run inside isolated containers, experience gained by the first instance of an application
cannot be easily shared with subsequent scaled instances. This
results in both increased startup time and response timeout
errors for the scaled instances as well as increased performance
interference for any co-located applications; reacquiring this
experience is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.
We propose a scalable and secure technique to share dynamically
compiled artifacts produced by the first execution instance of an
application and otherwise created for intra-OS sharing only with
subsequent scaled or restarted instances as a solution to these
problems. Our solution abides by the usual PaaS limitations and
uses a distributed and containerized cloud service, which we
experimentally show to be scalable on a Docker Swarm running
on top of a 6-VM cluster; also, we discuss the results of a usability
survey for the serviceâ€™s GUI conducted with expert subjects. The
effectiveness of the DCAS technique was experimentally tested
on an isolated installation of the PaaS software Cloudy Foundry;
we measured significant reductions in both the startup time and
response errors of scaled out instances as well as performance
interference to co-located tenants during scaling.
