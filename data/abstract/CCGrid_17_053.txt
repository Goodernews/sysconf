
The vast attack surface of clouds presents a challenge in deploying scalable and effective defenses. Traditional
security mechanisms, which work from inside the VM fail to
provide strong protection as attackers can bypass them easily.
The only available option is to provide security from the layer
below the VM i.e., the hypervisor. Previous works that attempt
to secure VMs from “outside” either incur substantial space
or compute overheads making them slow and impractical or
require modifications to the OS or the application codebase. To
address these issues, we propose an anomaly detection fabric
for clouds based on system call monitoring, which compresses
the stream of system calls at their source making the system
scalable and near real-time. Our system requires no modifications
to the guest OS or the application making it ideal for the data
center setting. Additionally, for robust and early detection of
threats, we leverage the notion of VM/container communities that
share information about attacks in their early stages to provide
immunity to the entire deployment. We make certain aspects
of the system flexible so that vendors can tune metrics to offer
customized protection to clients based on their workload types.
Detailed evaluation on a prototype implementation on KVM
substantiates our claims.
