is that they do not scale well. As the number of participants trying to achieve consensus increases, increasing network traffic can
quickly overwhelm the network from topology-oblivious broadcasts, or a central coordinator for centralized consensus protocols.
Thus, either achieving strong consensus is restricted to a handful
of participants, or developers must resort to weaker models of consensus.

We propose Canopus, a highly-parallel consensus protocol that
is ‘plug-compatible’ with ZooKeeper, which exploits modern data
center network topology, parallelism, and consensus semantics to
achieve scalability with respect to the number of participants and
throughput (i.e., the number of key-value reads/writes per second). In our prototype implementation, compared to EPaxos and
ZooKeeper, Canopus increases throughput by more than 4x and
16x respectively for read-heavy workloads.
