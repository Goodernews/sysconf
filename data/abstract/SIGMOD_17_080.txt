multi-dimensional data that are mainly processed with distributed
array databases. These raw arrays are “cooked” into derived data
products using complex pipelines that are time-consuming. As a
result, derived data products are released infrequently and become
stale soon thereafter. In this paper, we introduce materialized array
views as a database construct for scientific data products. We model
the “cooking” process as incremental view maintenance with batch
updates and give a three-stage heuristic that finds effective update
plans. Moreover, the heuristic repartitions the array and the view
continuously based on a window of past updates as a side-effect
of view maintenance without overhead. We design an analytical
cost model for integrating materialized array views in queries. A
thorough experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed techniques are able to incrementally maintain a real astronomical data
product in a production environment.
