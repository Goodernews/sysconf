data-centers, which results in huge monetary cost for data-center operators. Due to the hardware heterogeneity and contentions between concurrent workloads, straggler mitigation is important to many Big Data
applications running in large-scale data-centers and the speculative execution technique is widely-used to handle stragglers. Although a large
number of studies have been proposed to improve the performance of Big
Data applications using speculative execution, few of them have studied
the energy efficiency of their solutions. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the energy efficiency of speculative executions while
ensuring comparable performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical straggler detection mechanism which can greatly reduce the number
of killed speculative copies and hence save the energy consumption. We
also propose an energy-aware speculative copy allocation method which
considers the trade-off between performance and energy when allocating
speculative copies. We implement both techniques into Hadoop and evaluate them using representative MapReduce benchmarks. Results show
that our solution can reduce the energy waste on killed speculative copies
by up to 100% and improve the energy efficiency by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art mechanisms.
