classes, including web pages, images, videos and software downloads. It is economically advantageous for a CDN to cache and
deliver all traffic classes using a shared distributed cache server
infrastructure. However, such sharing of cache resources across
multiple traffic classes poses significant cache provisioning challenges that are the focus of this paper.

Managing a vast shared caching infrastructure requires careful
modeling of user request sequences for each traffic class. Using
extensive traces from Akamaiâ€™s CDN, we show how each traffic
class has drastically different object access patterns, object size
distributions, and cache resource requirements. We introduce the
notion of a footprint descriptor that is a succinct representation of
the cache requirements of a request sequence. Leveraging novel
connections to Fourier analysis, we develop a footprint descriptor
calculus that allows us to predict the cache requirements when
different traffic classes are added, subtracted and scaled to within a
prediction error of 2.5%. We integrated our footprint calculus in the
cache provisioning operations of the production CDN and show
how it is used to solve key challenges in cache sizing, traffic mixing,
and cache partitioning.
