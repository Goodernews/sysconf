
Scalable Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have become the
de facto interconnection mechanism in large scale Chip Multiprocessors. Not only are NoCs devouring a large fraction of
the on-chip power budget but static NoC power consumption is
becoming the dominant component as technology scales down.
Hence reducing static NoC power consumption is critical for
energy-efficient computing. Previous research has proposed to
power-gate routers attached to inactive cores so as to save static
power, but they either required centralized decision making and
global network knowledge or a non-scalable escape ring network.
In this paper, we propose Fly-Over (FLOV), a light-weight distributed mechanism for power gating routers, which encompasses
FLOV router microarchitecture and a partition-based dynamic
routing algorithm to maintain network functionality. With simple
modifications to the baseline router microarchitecture, FLOV can
facilitate fly-over links over power-gated routers. The proposed
routing algorithm provides best-effort minimal path routing
without the necessity for global network information. We evaluate
our scheme using synthetic workloads as well as real workloads
from PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suite. The results show that FLOV
can achieve 19.2% latency reduction and 16.9% total power
savings.
