
Designing low-latency network topologies of
switches is a key objective for next-generation large-scale
clusters. Low latency is preconditioned on low hop counts, but
existing network topologies have hop counts much larger than
theoretical lower bounds. To alleviate this problem, we propose
building network topologies based on uni-directional graphs that
are known to have hop counts close to theoretical lower bounds.
A practical difficulty with uni-directional topologies is switchby-switch flow control, which we resolve by using hot-potato
routing. Cycle-accurate network simulation experiments for
various traffic patterns on uni-directional topologies show that
hot-potato routing achieves performance comparable to that of
conventional deadlock-free routing. Similar experiments are used
to compare several uni-directional topologies to bi-directional
topologies, showing that the former achieve significantly
lower latency and higher throughput. We quantify end-to-end
application performance for parallel application benchmarks via
discrete-even simulation, showing that uni-directional topologies
can lead to large application performance improvements over
their bi-directional counterparts. Finally, we discuss practical
issues for uni-directional topologies such as cabling complexity
and cost, power consumption, and soft-error tolerance. Our
results make a compelling case for considering uni-directional
topologies for upcoming large-scale clusters.
