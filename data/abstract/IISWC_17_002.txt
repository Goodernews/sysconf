
Datacenters often are a power utilityâ€™s largest
consumers, and are expected to participate in several power management scenarios with diverse characteristics in which Energy
Storage Devices (ESDs) are expected to play important roles.
Different ESD technologies exist, including little explored technologies such as flow batteries, that offer different performance
characteristics in cost, size, and environmental impact. While
prior works in datacenter ESD literature have considered one
of usage aspect, technology, performance metric (typically cost),
the whole three-dimensional space is little explored. Towards
understanding this design space, this paper presents first such
study towards joint characterization of ESD usages based on their
provisioning and operating demands, under ideal and realistic
ESD technologies, and quantify their impact on datacenter performance. We expect our work can help datacenter operators to
characterize this three-dimensional space in a systematic manner,
and make design decisions targeted towards cost-effective and
environmental impact aware datacenter energy management.
