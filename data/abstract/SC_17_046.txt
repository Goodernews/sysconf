
The OpenFlow-style Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology has shown promising performance in data centers and campus networks; and the HPC community is significantly interested
in adopting the SDN technology. However, while OpenFlow-style
SDN allows dynamic per-flow resource management using a global
network view, it does not support adaptive routing, which is widely
used in HPC systems. This gives rise to the question whether SDN
can achieve the performance that HPC systems expect with adaptive routing. In this work, we investigate possible methods to apply
the SDN technology on the current generation HPC interconnects
with the Dragonfly topology, and compare the performance of SDN
with that of adaptive routing. Our results indicate that adaptive
routing results in higher performance than SDN when both have
similar resource allocation for a given traffic condition. However,
SDN can use the global network view to compete with adaptive
routing by allocating network resources more effectively.
