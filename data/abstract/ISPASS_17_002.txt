observe that the complex interplay among processor, node,
and network sub-systems can profoundly affect the performance and power efficiency of the distributed computer
system. Therefore, to effectively cross-optimize hardware
and software components of a distributed computer system,
we need a full-system simulation infrastructure that can
precisely capture the complex interplay. Responding to the
aforementioned need, we present dist-gem5, a flexible, detailed, and open-source full-system simulation infrastructure that can model and simulate a distributed computer
system using multiple simulation hosts. Then we validate
dist-gem5 against a physical cluster and show that the latency and bandwidth of the simulated network sub-system
are within 18% of the physical one. Compared with the single threaded and parallel versions of gem5, dist-gem5
speeds up the simulation of a 63-node computer cluster by
83.1x and 12.8, respectively.
