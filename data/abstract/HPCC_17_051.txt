number of customers increases, consequently, many network
problems must be solved to ensure the quality of service. One
of the solutions that has proved its efficiency consists in using
Peer-to Peers architecture. However, they raise challenges such as
peers resource allocation. Most literature on tackle the problem
with optimal static rules found at off-line study of the system. In
this paper, we propose to formulate this problem as a dynamic
optimization problem, then, solve it using a dynamic learning
based optimization algorithm. The obtained results show that
using a dynamic resource allocation reduces the rejection rate
while enhancing the entropy of the system, in the face of a
dynamically changing title demand.
