flexible, controllable, and programmable enough to accommodate
dynamic streaming application needs. Second, the application-level
data routing over the pipelines do not exhibit optimal performance
for increasingly common one-to-many communication. To address
these problems, we propose an SDN-based real-time big data streaming framework called Typhoon, that tightly integrates SDN functionality into a real-time stream framework. By partially offloading
application-layer data routing and control to the network layer
via SDN interfaces and protocols, Typhoon provides on-the-fly
programmability of both the application and network layers, and
achieve high-performance data routing. In addition, Typhoon SDN
controller exposes cross-layer information, from both the application and the network, to SDN control plane applications to extend
the frameworkâ€™s functionality. We introduce several SDN control
plane applications to illustrate these benefits.
