
Smart cities are a natural evolution of the
recent wave of technology, allowing both to offer better
services to citizens and also to save costs. Nevertheless
the adoption of smart city solutions have to face major
problems, not due to technology but to society: economy
and inertia. Even if the adoption of smart city technologies
can bring to savings, new solutions need to face the general
inertia of public administrations, that would have to face
new expenses, without being familiar with these new kinds
of options, therefore opting out of the perceived risk.
For this reason we feel it is helpful to also consider a
variant of smart city technologies, dubbed “Smart Cheap
City” (SCC for short). A Smart Cheap City solution does
not necessarily aim to maximize benefits to citizen, or to
produce the biggest savings, but instead has a primary
focus: minimizing the cost of implementation. This leads
to lower the entry barrier, facilitating early adoption by
cities, and so acting as a gentle introduction to the benefits
of smart cities, fostering their wider and more effective
adoption. We report on a project based on the SCC
paradigm, tackling the waste management of a city, and
show how smart cheap city solutions can be effectively
used to provide both immediate benefit, and to overcome
the barriers that have so far slowed down their adoption.
