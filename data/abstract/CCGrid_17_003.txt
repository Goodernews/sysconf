
Hybrid cloud bursting (i.e., leasing temporary offpremise cloud resources to boost the overall capacity during
peak utilization) is a popular and cost-effective way to deal
with the increasing complexity of big data analytics. It is
particularly promising for iterative MapReduce applications that
reuse massive amounts of input data at each iteration, which
compensates for the high overhead and cost of concurrent data
transfers from the on-premise to the off-premise VMs over a
weak inter-site link that is of limited capacity. In this paper
we study how to combine various MapReduce data locality
techniques designed for hybrid cloud bursting in order to achieve
scalability for iterative MapReduce applications in a cost-effective
fashion. This is a non-trivial problem due to the complex
interaction between the data movements over the weak link
and the scheduling of computational tasks that have to adapt
to the shifting data distribution. We show that using the right
combination of techniques, iterative MapReduce applications can
scale well in a hybrid cloud bursting scenario and come even close
to the scalability observed in single sites.
