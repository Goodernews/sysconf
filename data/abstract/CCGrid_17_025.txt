computed correlation rules and process instances will greatly
help us to unleash the power of process mining. However,
exploring all possible event correlations over a log could be
time consuming, especially when the log is large. State-of-theart methods based on MapReduce designed to handle this challenge have offered significant performance improvements over
standalone implementations. However, all existing techniques are
still based on a conventional generating-and-pruning scheme.
Therefore, event partitioning across multiple machines is often
inefficient. In this paper, following the principle of filtering-andverification, we propose a new algorithm, called RF-GraP, which
provides a more efficient correlation over distributed systems.
We present the detailed implementation of our approach and
conduct a quantitative evaluation using the Spark platform.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is
indeed efficient. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we are able
to achieve significant performance speedups with obviously less
network communication.
