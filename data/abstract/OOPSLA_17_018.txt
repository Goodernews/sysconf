merge tools go further by partially exploiting the syntactic structure and semantics of the involved artifacts.
Previous studies compare these merge approaches with respect to the number of reported conflicts, showing,
for most projects and merge situations, reduction in favor of semistructured merge. However, these studies do
not investigate whether this reduction actually leads to integration effort reduction (productivity) without
negative impact on the correctness of the merging process (quality). To analyze that, and better understand
how merge tools could be improved, in this paper we reproduce more than 30,000 merges from 50 open source
projects, identifying conflicts incorrectly reported by one approach but not by the other (false positives),
and conflicts correctly reported by one approach but missed by the other (false negatives). Our results and
complementary analysis indicate that, in the studied sample, the number of false positives is significantly
reduced when using semistructured merge. We also find evidence that its false positives are easier to analyze
and resolve than those reported by unstructured merge. However, we find no evidence that semistructured
merge leads to fewer false negatives, and we argue that they are harder to detect and resolve than unstructured
merge false negatives. Driven by these findings, we implement an improved semistructured merge tool that
further combines both approaches to reduce the false positives and false negatives of semistructured merge.
We find evidence that the improved tool, when compared to unstructured merge in our sample, reduces the
number of reported conflicts by half, has no additional false positives, has at least 8% fewer false negatives,
and is not prohibitively slower.
