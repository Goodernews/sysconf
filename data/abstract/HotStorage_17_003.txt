backup and recovery. Our solution, BARNS addresses
these challenges, namely taking: a) cluster consistent
backup and ensuring repair free restore, b) storage efficient backups, and c) topology oblivious backup and restore. Due to eventual consistency semantics of these databases, traditional database backup techniques of performing quiesce do not guarantee cluster consistent
backup. Moreover, taking crash consistent backup increases recovery time due to the need for repairs. In this
paper, we provide detailed solutions for taking backup of
two popular, but architecturally different NoSQL DBs,
Cassandra and MongoDB, when hosted on shared storage. Our solution leverages database distribution and
partitioning knowledge along with shared storage features such as snapshots, clones to efficiently perform
backup and recovery of NoSQL databases. Our solution
gets rid of replica copies, thereby saving ~66% backup
space (under 3x replication). Our preliminary evaluation
shows that we require a constant restore time of ~2-3
mins, independent of backup dataset and cluster size.
