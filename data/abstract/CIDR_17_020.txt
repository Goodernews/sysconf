
An increasing amount of information is being collected in
structured, evolving, curated databases, driving the question
of how information extracted from such datasets via queries
should be cited. Unlike traditional research products, such
books and journals, which have a fixed granularity, data citation is a challenge because the granularity varies. Different
portions of the database, with varying granularity, may have
different citations. Furthermore, there are an infinite number of queries over a database, each accessing and generating
different subsets of the database, so we cannot hope to explicitly attach a citation to every possible result set and/or
query. We present the novel problem of automatically generating citations for general queries over a relational database,
and explore a solution based on a set of citation views, each
of which attaches a citation to a view of the database. Citation views are then used to automatically construct citations
for general queries. Our approach draws inspiration from results in two areas, query rewriting using views and database
provenance and combines them in a robust model. We then
discuss open issues in developing a practical solution to this
challenging problem.
