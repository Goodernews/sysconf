
Hyperspectral image classification has been proved
significant in remote sensing field. Traditional classification methods have meet bottlenecks due to the lack of remote sensing
background knowledge or high dimensionality. Deep learning
based methods, such as deep convolutional neural network
(CNN), can effectively extract high level features from raw data.
But the training of deep CNN is rather time-consuming. The
general purpose graphic processing units (GPUs) have been
considered as one of the most common co-processors that can help
accelerate deep learning applications. In this paper we propose
a GPU-based Cube CNN (GCN) framework for hyperspectral
image classification. First, a Parallel Neighbor Pixels Extraction
(PNPE) algorithm is designed to enable the framework directly
loading raw hyperspectral image into GPUâ€™s global memory, and
extracting samples into data cube. Then, based on the peculiarity
of hyperspectral image and cube convolution, we propose a
novel Cube CNN-to-GPU mapping mechanism that transfers the
training of Cube CNN to GPU effectively. Finally, the mini-batch
gradient descent(MBGD) algorithm is improved with Computing
United Device Architecture(CUDA) multi-streaming technique,
which further speeds up network training in GCN framework.
Experiments on KSC dataset, PU dataset and SA dataset show
that, compared with state-of-art framework Caffe, we achieve
up to 83% and 67% reduction in network training time without
losing accuracy, when using SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
and MBGD algorithm respectively. Experiments across different
GPUs show the same performance trend, which demonstrates the
good extendibility of GCN framework.
