
Interconnection networks must meet the communication demands of current High-Performance Computing systems. In order to interconnect efficiently the end nodes of these
systems with a good performance-to-cost ratio, new network
topologies have been proposed in the last years which leverage
high-radix switches, such as Slim Fly. Adversarial-like traffic
patterns, however, may reduce severely the performance of Slim
Fly networks when using only minimal-path routing. In order to
mitigate the performance degradation in these scenarios, Slim
Fly networks should configure an oblivious or adaptive nonminimal routing. The non-minimal routing algorithms proposed
for Slim Fly usually rely on Valiant’s algorithm to select the paths,
at the cost of doubling the average path-length, as well as the
number of Virtual Channels (VCs) required to prevent deadlocks.
Moreover, Valiant may introduce additional inefficiencies when
applied to Slim Fly networks, such as the “turn-around problem”
that we analyze in this work. With the aim of overcoming these
drawbacks, we propose in this paper two variants of the Valiant’s
algorithm that improve the non-minimal path selection in Slim
Fly networks. They are designed to be combined with adaptive
routing algorithms that rely on Valiant to select non-minimal
paths, such as UGAL or PAR, which we have adapted to the Slim
Fly topology. Through the results from simulation experiments,
we show that our proposals improve the network performance
and/or reduce the number of required VCs to prevent deadlocks,
even in scenarios with adversarial-like traffic.
