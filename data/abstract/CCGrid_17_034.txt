critical components for various organizations that depend on
the cloud in their daily operations. Customers’ data and the
organizations’ proprietary information have been subject to
various attacks in the past. In this paper, we develop a set
of Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategies that randomize
the location of the Virtual Machines (VMs) to harden the
cloud against a class of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) policybased attacks. These attack policies capture the behavior of
adversaries that seek to explore the allocation of VMs in the
cloud and exploit the ones that provide the highest rewards
(e.g., access to critical datasets, ability to observe credit card
transactions, etc). We assess through simulation experiments
the performance of our MTD strategies, showing that they
can make MAB policy-based attacks no more effective than
random attack policies. Additionally, we show the effects of
critical parameters — such as discount factors, the time between
randomizing the locations of the VMs and variance in the
rewards obtained - on the performance of our defenses. We
validate our results through simulations and a real OpenStack
system implementation in our lab to assess migration times and
down times under different system loads.
