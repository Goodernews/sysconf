
In a RFID enabled system, tagged products is
ordinarily required to be transferred from an owner to another,
which makes the ownership of corresponding tags change for
several times. To overcome problem of temporary ownership
transfer, a lightweight anonymous group ownership transfer
protocol is proposed in this paper. It involves ownership transfer
and ownership recovery for group tags, which are all based upon
mutual authentication. Compared with most of previous
protocols using hash functions and cryptographic suites, our
scheme only utilizes simple operations, which are completely
compliant with EPC Class-1 Generation-2 standard. Through
our scheme, the window problem in multi-owner environment is
first solved. Security analysis shows that our protocol can
provide security and privacy preservation. It is also
demonstrated that it resists various attacks. Performance
comparisons indicate that our scheme can meet necessary
security requirements and achieve better performance.
