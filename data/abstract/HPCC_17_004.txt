
Many scientific and engineering computations rely
on the scalable solution of large sparse linear systems. Preconditioned Krylov methods are widely used and offer many
algorithmic choices whose performance varies depending on the
characteristics of the linear system. In previous work, we have
shown that the performance of different Krylov methods at
small scales can be modeled using a small number of features
based on structural and numerical properties of the input linear
system. In this paper, we focus on comparing the scalability of
parallel Krylov methods given different input properties without
requiring extensive empirical measurements. We consider the
PETSc implementations of Newton-Krylov methods to produce
scalability rankings based on our new comparative modeling
approach. The model-based ranking is validated by comparison
with empirical results on a numerical simulation of driven fluid
flow in a cavity.
