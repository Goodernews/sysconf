processors, the scheduler must distribute the resource among the
processors (e.g., for three processors in shares of 20%, 15%, and 65%)
and adjust this distribution over time. Each job j comes with a size
pj € Randa resource requirement r; > 0. Jobs do not benefit when
receiving a share larger than 7; of the resource. But providing them
with a fraction of the resource requirement causes a linear decrease
in the processing efficiency. We seek a (non-preemptive) job and
resource assignment minimizing the makespan.

Our main result is an efficient approximation algorithm which
achieves an approximation ratio of 2+ 1/(m-—2). It can be improved
to an (asymptotic) ratio of 1+1/(m-—1) if all jobs have unit size. Our
algorithms also imply new results for a well-known bin packing
problem with splittable items and a restricted number of allowed
item parts per bin.

Based upon the above solution, we also derive an approximation algorithm with similar guarantees for a setting in which we
introduce so-called tasks each containing several jobs and where
we are interested in the average completion time of tasks (a task is
completed when all its jobs are completed).
