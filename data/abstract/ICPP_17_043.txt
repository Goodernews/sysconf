
The matrix-matrix multiplication is an essential
building block that can be found in various scientific and
engineering applications. High-performance implementations
of the matrix-matrix multiplication on state-of-the-art processors may be of great importance for both the vendors
and the users. In this paper, we present a detailed methodology of implementing and optimizing the double-precision
general format matrix-matrix multiplication (DGEMM) kernel
on the emerging SW26010 processor, which is used to build
the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. We propose a threelevel blocking algorithm to orchestrate data on the memory
hierarchy and expose parallelism on different hardware levels,
and design a collective data sharing scheme by using the
register communication mechanism to exchange data efficiently
among different cores. On top of those, further optimizations
are done based on a data-thread mapping method for efficient
data distribution, a double buffering scheme for asynchronous
DMA data transfer, and an instruction scheduling method
for maximizing the pipeline usage. Experiment results show
that the proposed DGEMM implementation can fully exploit
the unique hardware features provided by SW26010 and can
sustain up to 95% of the peak performance.
