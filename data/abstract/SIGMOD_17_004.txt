group-by attributes and know precisely what they are looking for.
This paper takes the first attempt towards automatically extracting
top-k insights from multi-dimensional data. This is useful not only
for non-expert users, but also reduces the manual effort of data
analysts. In particular, we propose the concept of insight which
captures interesting observation derived from aggregation results
in multiple steps (e.g., rank by a dimension, compute the percentage of measure by a dimension). An example insight is: “Brand B’s
rank (across brands) falls along the year, in terms of the increase in
sales”. Our problem is to compute the top-k insights by a score
function. It poses challenges on (i) the effectiveness of the result
and (ii) the efficiency of computation. We propose a meaningful
scoring function for insights to address (i). Then, we contribute a
computation framework for top-k insights, together with a suite of
optimization techniques (i.e., pruning, ordering, specialized cube,
and computation sharing) to address (ii). Our experimental study
on both real data and synthetic data verifies the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed solution.
