step towards a general big data platform for genome analysis pipelines. The key goals of this study are to develop a
thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of
big data technology for genomic data analysis, and to identify the key questions that the research community could address to realize the vision of personalized genomic medicine.
Our platform, called GESALL, is based on the new “Wrapper
Technology” that supports existing genomic data analysis
programs in their native forms, without having to rewrite
them. To do so, our system provides several layers of software, including a new Genome Data Parallel Toolkit (GDPT)
which can be used to “wrap” existing data analysis programs. This platform offers a concrete context for evaluating
big data technology for genomics: we report on super-linear
speedup and sublinear speedup for various tasks, as well as
the reasons why a parallel program could produce different
results from those of a serial program. These results lead to
key research questions that require a synergy between genomics scientists and computer scientists to find solutions.
