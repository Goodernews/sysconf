or containerization to improve server utilization. These technologies pose challenges for power monitoring since it is not
possible to directly measure the power use of an abstraction
such as a virtual machine. Much work has been done in
modeling the power use of CPUs, virtual machines and entire
servers; however, there is a scarcity of work in building
lightweight power monitoring middleware that can be deployed
across a range of systems. In this paper, we present cWatts+ as
a prototype lightweight software-based virtual power meter.
Utilizing a simple but powerful application-agnostic power
model, it offers comparable performance to existing “more
complex and heavier-weight” power models. It uses a small
number of widely available CPU event counters and the
Performance Application Programming Interface Library to
estimate power usage on a per-thread basis. It has minimal
overhead and is portable across a variety of systems. It can
be used in containerized or virtualized environments. We
evaluate the estimation performance of cWatts+ for a variety
of real-world benchmarks that are relevant to large distributed
systems. Also, we examine the importance of including CPU
core temperature data in the power model. We demonstrate
that our power model has an average error of less than 5%.
This result compares favorably with existing state-of-the-art
power models and is achieved using a relatively simple power
model that exhibits minimal power consumption (overhead).
Consequently, our power monitoring middleware is viable for
use in real-world applications such as power estimation for
energy-aware scheduling.
