
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is widely-used
for supervised dimension reduction and linear classification. Classical LDA, however, suffers from the i//-posed estimation problem
on data with high dimension and low sample size (HDLSS). To
cope with this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive
Wishart Discriminant Analysis (AVVD.A) for classification, that
makes predictions in an ensemble way. Comparing to existing
approaches, AWD.A has two advantages: 1) leveraging the
Wishart distribution, AVWVD.A ensembles multiple LDA classifiers
parameterized by the sampled covariance matrices via a Bayesian
Voting Scheme, which theoretically improves the robustness of
classification, compared to LDA classifiers using a single (probably ill-posed) covariance matrix estimator; 2) AWD.A updates
the weights for voting optimally to adapt the local information
of each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that AVVDA guarantees a
close approximation to the optimal Bayesian inference and thus
achieves robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin.
