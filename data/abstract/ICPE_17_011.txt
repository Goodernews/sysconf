and/or when it is not feasible or too time consuming to
monitor a running computer system. The main challenge in
these situations lies in estimating values for the parameters
of these models, especially the values of service demands
at the various devices for each transaction class. These estimates have to be compliant with the input-output relationships observed through measurements. This means that
solving a model of the system with the estimated parameters
should yield the same outputs (e.g., response times) for the
same inputs (e.g., arrival rates or concurrency level). This
paper presents a method for automatically estimating service demands for open, closed, single and multiclass queuing
networks (QN). The method is based on casting the estimation problem as a non-linear optimization problem. However, because the solution of closed QNs does not have a
closed form, we need to resort to black-box optimization
techniques. The parameter estimation method presented
here is part of Â«Model, a framework for automatically deriving performance models of systems whose detailed characteristics (structure and behavior) are unknown. Other portions of the framework were discussed in detail in previous
publications by the authors. This paper illustrates the ideas
through several numerical examples and then applies them
to a multi-tiered operational system running OFBiz. The
estimated service demands closely satisfy the input-output
relationships at various workload intensity levels and can be
used for prediction purposes.
