
Assessing the effectiveness of a demand response
(DR) program requires appropriate metrics of performance. In
this paper, we propose the assessment of an aggregator-based
residential DR program using two newly developed metrics
addressing the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. The economic sustainability metric of the DR method
is quantified by the economic savings of the customers on
electricity charges and the aggregatorâ€™s profit. The environmental
sustainability is quantified by measuring the reduction in capacity
factors of fossil-fueled peaking power plants and the subsequent
reduction in CQ. emissions. A simulation study is performed for
a large-scale power system consisting of 5,555 users and 56,659
schedulable assets using real pricing data from a utility and a
bulk electricity market for a 31-day period. Finally, we apply
high-performance computing methods to the month-long study
to yield a faster computation time.
