shutdown (due to reasons like battery run outs, overheating, or
automatic app upgrades) is annoying. What can be even worse
is that a phone user has to restart, from the very beginning, the
apps he or she was using when the phone got rebooted, because
all the app states would be lost, especially when the number of
apps in use is large. Hence, a recovery service is sorely needed
for today’s smartphones where apps are becoming increasingly
complex. While checkpointing has long been used for desktop and
laptop computers, such whole-system state preserving techniques
cannot be applied to smartphones directly, due to the constraints
of smartphones on energy, delay, and storage space.

In this paper, we propose SmartCP, an intelligent checkpointing methodology, in order to reduce the energy required
by a smartphone and the amount of efforts required by a
user to recover the app states after the smartphone restarts.
SmartCP selectively checkpoints the most important apps based
on the apps’ characteristics and predicted future usage, under
the resource constraints of the phone. We propose a novel
model that quantitatively analyzes the recovery energy and
efforts of each category of smartphone apps and formulate
selective checkpointing as a constrained optimization problem.
We prototype SmartCP on Android and evaluate it using realworld traces as well as real user feedback. The results show
that SmartCP outperforms two alternative app selection schemes
by saving 28% more energy and 39% more recovery efforts on
average.
