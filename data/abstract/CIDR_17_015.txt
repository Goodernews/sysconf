of finding those that match desired patterns. We demonstrate zenvisage, an interactive data exploration system tailored towards “fastforwarding” to desired trends, patterns, or insights, without much
effort from the user. zenvisage’s interface supports simple dragand-drop and sketch-based interactions as specification mechanisms
for the exploration need, as well as an intuitive data exploration
language called ZQL for more complex needs. zenvisage is being developed in collaboration with ad analysts, battery scientists,
and genomic data analysts, and will be demonstrated on similar
datasets.
