
. In this paper, we present a fine-grained multi-stage metricbased triangular remeshing algorithm on manycore and NUMA architectures. It is motivated by the dynamically evolving data dependencies
and workload of such irregular algorithms, often resulting in poor performance and data locality at high number of cores. In this context, we
devise a multi-stage algorithm in which a task graph is built for each kernel. Parallelism is then extracted through fine-grained independent set,
maximal cardinality matching and graph coloring heuristics. In addition
to index ranges precalculation, a dual-step atomic-based synchronization
scheme is used for nodal data updates. Despite its intractable latencyboundness, a good overall scalability is achieved on a NUMA dual-socket
Intel Haswell and a dual-memory Intel KNL computing nodes (64 cores).
The relevance of our synchronization scheme is highlighted through a
comparison with the state-of-the-art.
