
. For the parallel-in-time integration method Parareal,
pipelining can be used to hide some of the cost of the serial correction
step and improve its efficiency. The paper introduces a basic OpenMP
implementation of pipelined Parareal and compares it to a standard
MPI-based variant. Both versions yield almost identical runtimes, but,
depending on the compiler, the OpenMP variant consumes about 7%
less energy and has a significantly smaller memory footprint. However,
its higher implementation complexity might make it difficult to use in
legacy codes and in combination with spatial parallelisation.
