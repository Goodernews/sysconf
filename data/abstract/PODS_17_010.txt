solutions, a critical and time-consuming task is that of feature engineering, for which various recipes and tooling approaches have been developed. In this framework paper, we
embark on the establishment of database foundations for feature engineering. We propose a formal framework for classification in the context of a relational database. The goal of
this framework is to open the way to research and techniques
to assist developers with the task of feature engineering by
utilizing the databaseâ€™s modeling and understanding of data
and queries, and by deploying the well studied principles of
database management. As a first step, we demonstrate the
usefulness of this framework by formally defining three key
algorithmic challenges. The first challenge is that of separability, which is the problem of determining the existence of
feature queries that agree with the training examples. The
second is that of evaluating the VC dimension of the model
class with respect to a given sequence of feature queries. The
third challenge is identifiability, which is the task of testing
for a property of independence among features that are represented as database queries. We give preliminary results
on these challenges for the case where features are defined
by means of conjunctive queries, and in particular we study
the implication of various traditional syntactic restrictions
on the inherent computational complexity.
