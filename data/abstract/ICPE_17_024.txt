fusion of Transactional (OLTP) and Analytical (OLAP) systems, eschewing ETL processes and introducing a plethora
of proposals for the so-called Hybrid Analytical and Transactional Processing (HTAP) systems.

Unfortunately, current benchmarking approaches are not
able to comprehensively produce a unified metric from the
assessment of an HTAP system. The evaluation of both
engine types is done separately, leading to the use of disjoint
sets of benchmarks such as TPC-C or TPC-H.

In this paper we propose a new benchmark, HTAPBench,
providing a unified metric for HTAP systems geared toward
the execution of constantly increasing OLAP requests limited by an admissible impact on OLTP performance. To
achieve this, a load balancer within HTAPBench regulates
the coexistence of OLTP and OLAP workloads, proposing
a method for the generation of both new data and requests,
so that OLAP requests over freshly modified data are comparable across runs.

We demonstrate the merit of our approach by validating
it with different types of systems: OLTP, OLAP and HTAP;
showing that the benchmark is able to highlight the differences between them, while producing queries with comparable complexity across experiments with negligible variability.
