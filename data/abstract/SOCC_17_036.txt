price that is much lower than the fixed price of on-demand VMs. In
exchange, spot VMs expose applications to multiple forms of risk,
including price risk, or the risk that a VM’s price will increase relative to others. Since spot prices vary continuously across hundreds
of different types of VMs, flexible applications can mitigate price
risk by moving to the VM that currently offers the lowest cost. To
enable this flexibility, we present HotSpot, a resource container that
“hops” VMs—by dynamically selecting and self-migrating to new
VMs~as spot prices change. HotSpot containers define a migration
policy that lowers cost by determining when to hop VMs based on
the transaction costs (from vacating a VM early and briefly double
paying for it) and benefits (the expected cost savings). As a side effect of migrating to minimize cost, HotSpot is also able to reduce the
number of revocations without degrading performance. HotSpot
is simple and transparent: since it operates at the systems-level on
each host VM, users need only run an HotSpot-enabled VM image
to use it. We implement a HotSpot prototype on EC2, and evaluate it
using job traces from a production Google cluster. We then compare
HotSpot to using on-demand VMs and spot VMs (with and without
fault-tolerance) in EC2, and show that it is able to lower cost and
reduce the number of revocations without degrading performance.
