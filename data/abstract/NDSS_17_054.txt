
Intel SGX, a new security capability in emerging
CPUs, allows user-level application code to execute in hardwareisolated enclaves. Enclave memory is isolated from all other
software on the system, even from the privileged OS or hypervisor. While being a promising hardware-rooted building block,
enclaves have severely limited capabilities, such as no native
access to system calls and standard OS abstractions. These OS
