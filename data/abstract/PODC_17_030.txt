Initially, each node supports one up to n different opinions. Nodes
randomly and in parallel sample the opinions of constantly many
nodes. Based on these samples, they use an update rule to change
their own opinion. The goal is to reach consensus, a configuration
where all nodes support the same opinion.

We compare two well-known update rules: 2-CHoIcEs and 3Mayortty. In the former, each node samples two nodes and adopts
their opinion if they agree. In the latter, each node samples three
nodes: If an opinion is supported by at least two samples the node
adopts it, otherwise it randomly adopts one of the sampled opinions.
Known results for these update rules focus on initial configurations

with a limited number of colors (say ni ), or typically assume a bias,
where one opinion has a much larger support than any other. For
such biased configurations, the time to reach consensus is roughly
the same for 2-CHOICEs and 3-MajorITy.

Interestingly, we prove that this is no longer true for configurations with a large number of initial colors. In particular, we
show that 3-Majority reaches consensus with high probability
in O(n3/4 - log’/® n) rounds, while 2-Cuotces can need Q(n/log n)
rounds. We thus get the first unconditional sublinear bound for
3-Mayjorirty and the first result separating the consensus time of
these processes. Along the way, we develop a framework that allows
a fine-grained comparison between consensus processes from a
specific class. We believe that this framework might help to classify
the performance of more consensus processes.
