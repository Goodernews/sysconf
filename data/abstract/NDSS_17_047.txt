trafﬁc in the Tor network (“correlation attacks”) have generally
relied on analyzing trafﬁc from TCP connections. The TCP
connections of a typical client application, however, are often
accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional
trafﬁc presents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This
paper quantiﬁes how DNS trafﬁc can make Tor users more vul-
nerable to correlation attacks. We investigate how incorporating
DNS trafﬁc can make existing correlation attacks more powerful
and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties
about anonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to
identify the DNS resolvers of Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new
set of correlation attacks (DefecTor attacks) that incorporate DNS
trafﬁc to improve precision; (iii) analyze the Internet-scale effects
of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop improved
methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we ﬁnd that there
exist adversaries that can mount DefecTor attacks: for example,
Google’s DNS resolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests
exiting the Tor network. We also ﬁnd that DNS requests often
traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP connections do not
transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about Tor
users’ trafﬁc. We then show that an adversary that can mount a
DefecTor attack can often determine the website that a Tor user
is visiting with perfect precision, particularly for less popular
websites where the set of DNS names associated with that website
may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor Path Simulator
(TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points
co-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level
adversaries that might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.
