
In this paper, we present an efficient type-agnostic
approach for finding sub-sequences in data, such as text documents or GPS trajectories. Our approach relies on data
deduplication for creating an inverted index. In contrast with
existing data deduplication techniques that chunk raw sequences
of characters arbitrarily, our approach preserves the semantics
of the original sequence via the notion of token and can be used
to index normalized data. When compared to indexing methods
that preserve the semantics and operate on normalized data, our
method increases the relevance of the inverted index, reduces its
size and improves its performances. Since data normalization
is generally not used beyond the scope of textual data, we
introduce a framework that helps identify the extent to which
data should be normalized regardless of its type. On this basis,
we demonstrate with a dataset made of GPS trajectories that
our method can be used agnostically: it can be used to index
and query data of a completely different type. Finally, we show
that the resulting spatial index is characterized by a better
discrimination than classical spatial indexing approaches.
