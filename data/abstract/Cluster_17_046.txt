
Graph models of social information systems typically contain trillions of edges. Such big graphs cannot be
processed on a single machine. The graph object must be
partitioned and distributed among machines and processed
in parallel on a computer cluster. Programming such systems
is very challenging. In this work, we present DH-Falcon,
a graph DSL (domain-specific language) which can be used
to implement parallel algorithms for large-scale graphs, targeting Distributed Heterogeneous (CPU and GPU) clusters.
DH-Falcon compiler is built on top of the Falcon compiler,
which targets single node devices with CPU and multiple
GPUs. An important facility provided by DH-Falcon is that it
supports mutation of graph objects, which allows programmer
to write dynamic graph algorithms. Experimental evaluation
shows that DH-Falcon matches or outperforms state-of-theart frameworks and gains a speedup of up to 13x.
