
High-radix routers with low latency and high
bandwidth play an increasingly important role in the design of
large-scale interconnection networks such as those used in supercomputers and datacenters. The tile-based crossbar approach
partitions a single large crossbar into many small tiles and can
considerably reduce the complexity of arbitration while providing
throughput higher than the conventional switch implementation.
However, it is not scalable due to power consumption, placement,
and routing problems. In this paper, we propose a truly scalable
router microarchitecture called Multiport Binding Tile-based
Router (MBTR). By aggregating multiple physical ports into a
single tile a high-radix router can be flexibly organized into a
different array of tiles, thus the number of tiles and hardware
overhead can be considerably reduced. Compared with a
hierarchical crossbar, MBTR achieves up to 50%~75% reduction
in memory consumption as well as wire area. Simulation results
demonstrate MBTR is indistinguishable from the YARC router in
terms of throughput and delay, and can even outperform it by
reducing potential contention for output ports. We have fabricated
an ASIC MBTR chip with 28nm technology. Internally, it runs at
700MHz and 30ns latency without any speedup. We also discuss
how the microarchitecture parameters of MBTR can be adjusted
based on the power, area, and design complexity constraints of the
arbitration logic.
