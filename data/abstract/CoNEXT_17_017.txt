growth in video traffic, rising expectations of high video quality of
experience (QoE), and the proliferation of varied content delivery
network (CDN) deployments (e.g., cloud computing-based, content
provider-owned datacenters, and ISP-owned CDNs). More fundamentally though, content providers are shifting delivery from a
single CDN to multiple CDNs, through the use of a content broker.
Brokers have been shown to invalidate many traditional delivery
assumptions (e.g., shifting traffic invalidates short- and long-term
traffic prediction) by not communicating their decisions with CDNs.
In this work, we analyze these problems using data from a CDN and
a broker. We examine the design space of potential solutions, finding that a marketplace design (inspired by advertising exchanges)
potentially provides interesting tradeoffs. A marketplace allows all
CDNs to profit on video delivery through fine-grained pricing and
optimization, where CDNs learn risk-adverse bidding strategies to
aid in traffic prediction. We implement a marketplace-based system
(which we dub Video Delivery eXchange or VDX) in CDN and broker
data-driven simulation, finding significant improvements in cost
and data-path distance.
