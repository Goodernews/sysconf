
Achieving high performance on modern systems is challenging.
Even with a detailed profile from a performance tool, writing or
refactoring a program to remove its performance issues is still a
daunting task for application programmers: it demands lots of
program optimization expertise that is often system specific.

Vendors often provide some detailed optimization guides to assist
programmers in the process. However, these guides are frequently
hundreds of pages long, making it difficult for application programmers to master and memorize all the rules and guidelines and
properly apply them to a specific problem instance.

In this work, we develop a framework named Egeria to alleviate
the difficulty. Through Egeria, one can easily construct an advising
tool for a certain high performance computing (HPC) domain (e.g.,
GPU programming) by providing Egeria with a optimization guide
or other related documents for the target domain. An advising
tool produced by Egeria provides a concise list of essential rules
automatically extracted from the documents. At the same time, the
advising tool serves as a question-answer agent that can interactively offers suggestions for specific optimization questions. Egeria
is made possible through a distinctive multi-layered design that
leverages natural language processing techniques and extends them
with knowledge of HPC domains and how to extract information
relevant to code optimization Experiments on CUDA, OpenCL, and
Xeon Phi programming guides demonstrate, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, the usefulness of Egeria for HPC.
