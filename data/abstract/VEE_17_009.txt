
We introduce Sky, an extension to the VMM that gathers
insights and information by intercepting system calls made
by guest applications. We show how Sky gains three specific
insights — guest file-size information, metadata-data distinction, and file-content hints — and uses said information to
enhance virtualized-storage performance. By caching small
files and metadata with higher priority, Sky reduces the runtime by 2.3 to 8.8 times for certain workloads. Sky also
achieves 4.5 to 18.7 times reduction in the runtime of an
open-source block-layer deduplication system by exploiting
hints about file contents. Sky works underneath both Linux
and FreeBSD guests, as well as under a range of file systems,
thus enabling portable and general VMM-level optimization
underneath a wide range of storage stacks.
