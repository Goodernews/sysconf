
HPC (high-performance computing) applications
usually show bursty I/O behaviors. In order to expedite the
applications, permanent storage systems are usually provisioned
to serve such I/O bursts. Approaching the era of exascale
computing, non-volatile RAM is introduced as burst buffers,
to absorb the bursty bulk data and relax the I/O provisioning
requirement of the permanent storage systems. However, without
judiciously draining the burst buffers, I/O bursts are passed
down to the underlying storage systems, which causes severe
V/O contention issues.

In order to minimize the I/O provisioning requirement and
resolve the issues caused by I/O bursts, we propose a proactive
draining scheme to manage the draining process of distributed
node-local burst buffers. In addition, we develop an I/O provisioning model to predict the minimized I/O provisioning requirement
for permanent storage systems. Evaluation results show that
applying the proactive draining scheme largely relaxes the I/O
provisioning requirement while preserving the I/O performance
of underlying storage systems.
