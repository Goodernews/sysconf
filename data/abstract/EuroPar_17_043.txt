with different processing and interconnection speeds, as well as varying
prices. Furthermore, the tasks of many parallel applications show different computational demands due to load imbalance. These differences
can be exploited for improving the cost efficiency of parallel applications in many cloud environments by matching application requirements
to instance types. In this paper, we introduce the concept of heterogeneous cloud systems consisting of different instance types to leverage
the different computational demands of large parallel applications for
improved cost efficiency. We present a mechanism that automatically
suggests a suitable combination of instances based on a characterization
of the application and the instance types. With such a heterogeneous
cloud, we are able to improve cost efficiency significantly for a variety of
MPI-based applications, while maintaining a similar performance.
