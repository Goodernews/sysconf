
Applications hosted in the cloud have become
indispensable in several contexts, with their performance often
being key to business operation and their running costs needing
to be minimized. To minimize running costs, most modern
virtualization technologies such as Linux Containers, Xen, and
KVM offer powerful resource control primitives for individual
provisioning — that enable adding or removing of fraction of
cores and/or megabytes of memory for as short as few seconds.
Despite the technology being ready, there is a lack of proper
techniques for fine-grained resource allocation, because there
is an inherent challenge in determining the correct composition
of resources an application needs, with varying workload, to
ensure deterministic performance.

This paper presents a control-based approach for the management of multiple resources, accounting for the resource consumption, together with the application performance, enabling
fine-grained vertical elasticity. The control strategy ensures
that the application meets the target performance indicators,
consuming as less resources as possible. We carried out an
extensive set of experiments using different applications —interactive with response-time requirements, as well as noninteractive with throughput desires — by varying the workload
mixes of each application over time. The results demonstrate
that our solution precisely provides guaranteed performance
while at the same time avoiding both resource over- and underprovisioning.
