Network usage accountability is critical in helping operators and
customers of multi-tenant data centers deal with concerns such
as capacity planning, resource allocation, hotspot detection, link
failure detection, and troubleshooting. However, the cost of measurements and instrumentation to achieve flow-level accountability
is non-trivial. We propose Polygravity to determine tenant traffic
usage via lightweight measurements in multi-tenant data centers.
We adopt a tomogravity model widely used in ISP networks, and
adapt it to a multi-tenant data center environment. By integrating datacenter-specific domain knowledge, sampling-based partial
estimation and gravity-based internal sinks/sources estimation,
Polygravity addresses two key challenges for adapting tomogravity
to a data center environment: sparse traffic matrices and internal
traffic sinks/sources. We conducted extensive evaluation of our approach using realistic data center workloads. Our results show that
Polygravity can determine tenant IP flow usage with less than 1%
average relative error for tenants with fine-grained domain knowledge. In addition, for tenants with coarse-grained domain knowledge and with partial host-based sampling, Polygravity reduces the
relative error of sampling-based estimation by 5
