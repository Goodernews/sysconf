
Despite the fact that JSON is currently one of the most "first": "John",
popular formats for exchanging data on the Web, there are "last": "Doe"
very few studies on this topic and there is no agreement upon , stu ag

a theoretical framework for dealing with JSON. Therefore
in this paper we propose a formal data model for JSON
documents and, based on the common features present in
available systems using JSON, we define a lightweight query
language allowing us to navigate through JSON documents.
We also introduce a logic capturing the schema proposal
for JSON and study the complexity of basic computational
tasks associated with these two formalisms.
