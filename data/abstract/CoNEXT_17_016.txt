360◦
Panoramic or
video streaming has been supported by a
wide range of content providers and mobile devices. Yet existing work primarily focused on streaming on-demand 360◦
videos stored on servers. In this paper, we examine a more
challenging problem: Can we stream real-time interactive
360◦ videos across existing LTE cellular networks, so as to
trigger new applications such as ubiquitous 360◦ video chat
and panoramic outdoor experience sharing? To explore the
feasibility and challenges underlying this vision, we design
POI360, a portable interactive 360◦ video telephony system
that jointly investigates both panoramic video compression
and responsive video stream rate control. For the challenge
that the legacy spatial compression algorithms for 360◦ video
suffer from severe quality fluctuations as the user changes
her region-of-interest (ROI), we design an adaptive compression scheme, which dynamically adjusts the compression
strategy to stabilize the video quality within ROI under various user input and network condition. In addition, to meet
the responsiveness requirement of panoramic video telephony, we leverage the diagnostic statistics on commodity
phones to promptly detect cellular link congestion, hence
significantly boosting the rate control responsiveness. Extensive field tests for our real-time POI360 prototype validate
its effectiveness in enabling panoramic video telephony over
the highly dynamic cellular networks.
