specifying detailed behaviors within an executable UML
model. The Alf implementation in MagicDraw, a leading
commercial tool for modeling using the Unified Modeling
Language (UML) from No Magic, Inc., aims to support the
practical application of Alf in real-world uses of
executable UML modeling. It includes syntax-aware
editing and checking of Alf code, with valid code
automatically and transparently compiled into UML
activity models. The resulting models are fully integrated
within the wider UML modeling context, and they can
then be executed as part of full system simulation
scenarios. The Alf compiler also tracks the dependencies
of all Alf text on other UML model elements, allowing for
automatic re-checking and re-building the Alf code as
necessitated by changes in referenced elements. The goal
is to provide an IDE-level experience for the easy entry
and maintenance of Alf code within an overall executable
UML model.
