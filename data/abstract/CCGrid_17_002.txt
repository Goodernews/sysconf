
In this paper, we propose a data acquisition and
analysis framework for materials-to-devices processes, named
4CeeD, that focuses on the immense potential of capturing,
accurately curating, correlating, and coordinating materialsto-devices digital data in a real-time and trusted manner
before fully archiving and publishing them for wide access and
sharing. In particular, 4CeeD consists of: (i) a curation service
for collecting data from experimental instruments, curating,
and wrapping of data with extensive metadata in real-time
and in a trusted manner, (ii) a cloudlet for caching collected
data from curation service and coordinating data transfer
with the back-end, and (iii) a cloud-based coordination service
for storing data, extracting meta-data, analyzing and finding
correlations among the data. Our evaluation results show that
our proposed approach is able to help researchers significantly
save time and cost spent on experiments, and is efficient
in dealing with high-volume and fast-changing workload of
heterogeneous types of experimental data.
