
In this paper we describe a new, efficient predictive scheduling methodology for implementing computing
infrastructure power savings using private clouds. Our approach, termed “QPRED,” estimates the quantiles on the
distribution of future machine usage so that unneeded machines
may be powered down to save power. A cloud administrator
sets a bound on the probability that all available machines
will be powered down when a cloud request arrives. This
target probability is the basis of a Service Level Agreement
between the cloud administrator and all cloud users covering
start-up delay resulting from power savings. Our results,
validated using activity traces from several private clouds used
in commercial production, indicate that QPRED successfully
reduces power consumption substantially while maintaining the
SLAs specified by the cloud administrator.
