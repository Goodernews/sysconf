
We investigate the use of content-based publish/subscribe for data
dissemination in large-scale applications with expressive filtering
requirements. In particular, we focus on top-k subscription filtering, where a publication is delivered only to the k best ranked subscribers, as ordered using expressive semantics such as relevance,
fairness, and diversity. The naive approach to perform filtering
early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of
the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the
well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based
publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We
extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel
algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. We also establish a framework for supporting
different types of ranking semantics and propose an implementation
to support fairness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline
covering system and perform sensitivity analysis to demonstrate
that our optimized rank-cover algorithm retains both covering and
fairness while achieving properties advantageous to our targeted
workloads. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable,
selects fairly, and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.
