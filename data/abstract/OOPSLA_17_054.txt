physical sciences. Tensors are often sparse and compound operations must frequently be computed in a single
kernel for performance and to save memory. Programmers are left to write kernels for every operation of
interest, with different mixes of dense and sparse tensors in different formats. The combinations are infinite,
which makes it impossible to manually implement and optimize them all. This paper introduces the first
compiler technique to automatically generate kernels for any compound tensor algebra operation on dense
and sparse tensors. The technique is implemented in a C++ library called taco. Its performance is competitive
with best-in-class hand-optimized kernels in popular libraries, while supporting far more tensor operations.
