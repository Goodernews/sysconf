
NVIDIA GPUDirect is a family of technologies
aimed at optimizing data movement among GPUs (P2P) or
between GPUs and third-party devices (RDMA). GPUDirect
Asyne, introduced in CUDA 8.0, is a new addition which
allows direct synchronization between GPU and third party
devices. For example, Async allows an NVIDIA GPU to directly
trigger and poll for completion of communication operations
queued to an InfiniBand Connect-IB network adapter, removing
CPU involvement from the critical path in GPU accelerated
applications. In this paper, we present the building blocks of
GPUDirect Async and explain the supported usage models of
this new technology. We also present a performance evaluation
using a micro-benchmark and a synthetic stencil benchmark.
Finally, we demonstrate the use of Async in a few multi-GPU
MPI applications: HPGMG-FV (geometric multi-grid), achieving
up to 25% improvement in total execution time; CoMD-CUDA
(classical molecular dynamics), reducing communications times
up to 30%; LULESH2-CUDA, achieving an average performance
improvement of 13% in the total execution time.
