
We present a high-resolution simulation of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman

earthquake, including non-linear frictional failure on a megathrustsplay fault system. Our method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction zones that are
crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation.
These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations
enable analysis of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.

To tackle the extreme size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We
established a novel clustered local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up of 13.6 compared
to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with 221
million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on
86,016 Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output
to overlap I/O and compute time.
