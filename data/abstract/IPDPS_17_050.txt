
The classic vehicle routing problem (VRP) is generally concerned with the optimal design of routes by a fleet
of vehicles to service a set of customers by minimizing the
overall cost, usually the travel distance for the whole set of
routes. Although the problem has been extensively studied in the
context of operations research and optimization, there is little
research on solving the VRP, where distributed vehicles need to
compute their respective routes in a decentralized fashion. Our
first contribution is a synchronous distributed approximation
algorithm that solves the VRP. Using the duality theorem of
linear programming, we show that the approximation ratio of our
algorithm is O(n - (p)'/‚Äù-log(n+m)), where p is the maximum
cost of travel or service in the input VRP instance, 7 is the size
of the graph, and m is the number of vehicles. We report results
of simulations and discuss implementation of our algorithm on
a real fleet of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) that carry out a
set of tasks.
