leverages new software-defined network capabilities to build
cluster-based network-efficient storage system. NICE presents
novel techniques to co-design network routing and multicast with
storage replication, consistency, and load balancing to achieve
higher efficiency, performance, and scalability.

We implement the NICEKV prototype. NICEKV follows the
NICE approach in designing four essential network-centric
storage mechanisms: request routing, replication, consistency, and.
load balancing. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach
brings significant performance gains compared to the current keyvalue systems design: up to 7x put/get performance improvement,
up to 2x reduction in network load, 3x to 9x load reduction on the
storage nodes, and the elimination of scalability bottlenecks
present in current designs.
