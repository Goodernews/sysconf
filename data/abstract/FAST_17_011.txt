
We analyze how modern distributed storage systems behave in the presence of file-system faults such as data
corruption and read and write errors. We characterize
eight popular distributed storage systems and uncover
numerous bugs related to file-system fault tolerance. We
find that modern distributed systems do not consistently
use redundancy to recover from file-system faults: a
single file-system fault can cause catastrophic outcomes
such as data loss, corruption, and unavailability. Our results have implications for the design of next generation
fault-tolerant distributed and cloud storage systems.
