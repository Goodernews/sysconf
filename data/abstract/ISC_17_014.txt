
. The Parallel Research Kernels (PRK) are a tool to study
parallel architectures and runtime systems from an application perspective. They provide paper and pencil specifications and reference implementations of elementary operations covering a broad range of parallel
application patterns. Most of the current PRK are trivially statically
load-balanced. In a prior study we described a novel PRK that requires
dynamic load balancing, and demonstrated its effectiveness to assess
automatic dynamic load balancing capabilities of runtimes. While useful,
it did not fully represent the problem of greatest interest to researchers
of extreme scale computing systems, namely the occurrence of localized, discrete, transient disturbances (system noise). For that purpose we
introduce a new PRK, inspired by Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)
applications, which provides a proxy for the most detrimental property
of noise, namely abrupt and discrete change of local system load. We
give a detailed specification of the new PRK, highlighting the challenges
and corresponding design choices that make it compact, arbitrarily scalable and self-verifying. We also present an implementation of the AMR
PRK in MPI, with application-specific load balancing, as well as one in
Adaptive MPI that leverages the MPI version, but adds runtime orchestrated dynamic load balancing, along with a set of performance results.
These show that for applications that can be load balanced statically,
but experience occasional local changes in computational load, automatic
dynamic load balancing typically does not offer an advantage.
