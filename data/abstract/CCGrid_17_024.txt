
In virtualized datacenters (vDCs), dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) is used as one of the most
common techniques to achieve both energy- and resource- utilization efficiency. Live migrations of VMs are used for dynamic
consolidation but due to dynamic resource demand variation
of VMs may lead to frequent and non-optimal migrations.
Assuming deterministic workload of the VMs may ensure the
most energy/resource-efficient VM allocations but eventually may
lead to significant resource contention or under-utilization if
the workload varies significantly over time. On the other hand,
adopting a conservative approach by allocating VMs depending
on their peak demand may lead to low utilization, if the peak
occurs infrequently or for a short period of time. Therefore,
in this work we design a robust VM migration scheme that
strikes a balance between protection for resource contention and
additional energy costs due to powering on more servers while
considering uncertainties on VMs resource demands. We use the
theory of I robustness and derive a robust Mixed Integer Linear
programming (MILP) formulation. Due to the complexity, the
problem is hard to solve for online optimization and we propose
a novel heuristic based on Tabu search. Using several scenarios,
we show that that the proposed heuristic can achieve near optimal
solution qualities in a short time and scales well with the instance
sizes. Moreover, we quantitatively analyze the trade-off between
energy cost versus protection level and robustness.
