most computationally intensive efforts today. A key challenge
is the analysis of structure, substructure, and the merger
history for many billions of compact particle clusters, called
halos. Effectively representing the merging history of halos is
essential for many galaxy formation models used to generate
synthetic sky catalogs, an important application of modern
cosmological simulations. Generating realistic mock catalogs
requires computing the halo formation history from simulations
with large volumes and billions of halos over many time steps,
taking hundreds of terabytes of analysis data. We present
fast parallel algorithms for producing halo merger trees and
tracking halo substructure from a single-level, density-based
clustering algorithm. Merger trees are created from analyzing
the halo-particle membership function in adjacent snapshots,
and substructure is identified by tracking the “cores” of
merging halos — sets of particles near the halo center. Core
tracking is performed after creating merger trees and uses
the relationships found during tree construction to associate
substructures with hosts. The algorithms are implemented with
MPI and evaluated on a Cray XK7 supercomputer using up to
16,384 processes on data from HACC, a modern cosmological
simulation framework. We present results for creating merger
trees from 101 analysis snapshots taken from the Q Continuum,
a large volume, high mass resolution, cosmological simulation
evolving half a trillion particles.
