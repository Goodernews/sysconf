more popular nowadays. Query processing on terrain data has
attracted considerable attention from both the academic community and the industry community. One fundamental and important
query is the shortest distance query and many other applications
such as proximity queries (including nearest neighbor queries and
range queries), 3D object feature vector construction and 3D object
data mining are built based on the result of the shortest distance
query. In this paper, we study the shortest distance query which
is to find the shortest distance between a point-of-interest and another point-of-interest on the surface of the terrain due to a variety
of applications. As observed by existing studies, computing the
exact shortest distance is very expensive. Some existing studies
proposed e€-approximate distance oracles where ¢ is a non-negative
real number and is an error parameter. However, the best-known algorithm has a large oracle construction time, a large oracle size and
a large distance query time. Motivated by this, we propose a novel
€-approximate distance oracle called the Space Efficient distance
oracle (SE) which has a small oracle construction time, a small oracle size and a small distance query time due to its compactness
storing concise information about pairwise distances between any
two points-of-interest. Our experimental results show that the oracle construction time, the oracle size and the distance query time
of SE are up to two orders of magnitude, up to 3 orders of magnitude and up to 5 orders of magnitude faster than the best-known
algorithm.
