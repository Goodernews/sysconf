move beyond coexistence mechanisms and understand the suitability of LTE’s synchronous operation in a spectrum that is governed
by asynchronous access principles. Our study reveals a fundamental conflict in LTE uplink access that arises between the scheduled
nature of LTE’s multi-user transmissions — critical for leveraging
the diversity (OFDMA) and multiplexing (multi-user MIMO) gains
— and the asynchronous nature of interference on the clients. The
result is a significant loss in spectrum utilization and throughput
that scales with the number of interfering terminals.

To tackle this critical challenge on the LTE uplink, we propose Biv. Btu transforms today’s LTE schedulers into speculative
schedulers that leverage interference diversity across clients to intelligently over-schedule clients on the same spectral resources to
prevent this utilization loss. BLu’s challenges lie in how to overschedule appropriate clients on the same resources without paying
the penalty of collisions, while containing the exponential overhead
incurred in measuring the required interference dependencies between clients. The under-pinning of BLu’s design includes a novel
mechanism to blue-print the very source of interference on LTE
clients along with their dependencies, which allows for a constant,
significantly reduced overhead. Btu can be realized in today’s LTE
base stations. Its realization in an enterprise environment with
SDRs (hosting LTE release 10) reveals appreciable gains of 1.5-2x
in both utilization and throughput over existing schemes for SISO
and MU-MIMO transmissions in unlicensed spectrum.
