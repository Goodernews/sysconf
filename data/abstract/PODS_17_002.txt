a full conjunctive query QO over p distributed servers. Two
prior results were known. First, for one-round algorithms
over skew-free data the optimal communication cost per
server is m/p! T*(Q) | where m is the size of the largest
input relation, and 7* is the fractional vertex covering
number of the query hypergraph. Second, for multi-round
algorithms and unrestricted database instances, it was
shown that any algorithm requires at least m/pl/ p*(Q)
communication cost per server, where p*(Q) is the fractional edge covering number of the query hypergraph; but
no matching algorithms were known for this case (except
for two restricted queries: chains and cycles).

In this paper we describe a multi-round algorithm that
computes any query with load m/p! p*(Q) per server, in
the case when all input relations are binary. Thus, we
prove this to be the optimal load for all queries over binary
input relations. Our algorithm represents a non-trivial
extension of previous algorithms for chains and cycles,
and exploits some unique properties of graphs, which no
longer hold for hyper-graphs.
