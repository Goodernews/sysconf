
Several optimizations have been proposed to improve the performance of the mobile Web. However, these optimizations often
overlook an important factor, energy. Given the importance of battery life for mobile users, we argue that such optimizations
should be evaluated for their impact on energy consumption. Unfortunately, teasing out the effect of an optimization on
the energy consumption of the page load process is difficult, even with the help of power monitors. This is because of the
complexity of the page loads, the high variance in page load times, and the relatively short-lived page load process.

In this paper, we present RECON, a modeling approach that predicts the energy consumption of any Web page load. Our
key intuition is to model page load times using low-level information about the page load process. RECON combines the
low-level page load information with coarse-grained resource monitoring to build a power model. Experiments across 50 Web
pages and under four different optimizations show that RECON can predict energy consumption for a Web page load with an
error of less than 5%. By leveraging low-level page load information, RECON can not only identify when a given optimization
negatively affects energy, but can also reveal why. Importantly, RECON allows us to quickly evaluate various optimization
choices with respect to both performance and energy.
