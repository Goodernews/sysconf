
Most present day switching systems, in Internet routers and
data-center switches, employ a single input-queued crossbar to interconnect input ports with output ports. Such
switches need to compute a matching, between input and
output ports, for each switching cycle (time slot). The main
challenge in designing such matching algorithms is to deal
with the unfortunate tradeoff between the quality of the
computed matching and the computational complexity of
the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a general approach
that can significantly boost the performance of both Serena
and iSLIP, yet incurs only O(1) additional computational
complexity at each input/output port. Our approach is a
novel proposing strategy, called Queue-Proportional Sampling (QPS), that generates an excellent starter matching.
We show, through rigorous simulations, that when starting
with this starter matching, iSLIP and Serena can output
much better final matching decisions, as measured by the
resulting throughput and delay performance, than they otherwise can.
