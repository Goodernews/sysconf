
This paper develops an algorithm to identify and
geo-locate real world events that may be present as social activity
signals in two different social networks. Specifically, we focus on
content shared by users on Twitter and Instagram in order to
design a system capable of fusing data across multiple networks.
Past work has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to detect
physical events using various social network platforms. However,
many of these signals need corroboration in order to handle
events that lack proper support within a single network. We
leverage this insight to design an unsupervised approach that can
correlate event signals across multiple social networks. location
of the event occurrence. We evaluate our algorithm using both
simulations and real world datasets collected using Twitter and
Instagram. The results indicate that our algorithm siginificantly
improves false positive elimination and attains high precision
compared to baseline methods on real world datasets.
