method for solving engineering problem. Implementations of FEA
are common high performance computing (HPC) applications.
As a typical application of FEA, surface reconstruction of large
model, proves to be a computationally expensive task as well.
Poisson Surface Reconstruction, a cutting-edge surface reconstruction algorithm, is a commonly used method for efficiently
solving linear systems and it creates watertight surfaces from
oriented point sets. Poisson Surface Reconstruction leverages
an octree-based Marching Cubes (MC) method for isosurface
extraction. Hierarchical octree structure avoids unnecessary cells
visiting and prevents cracks arising. In this paper, we integrate
several quality improved methods with MC and coordinate unrelated components, obtaining a better quality mesh implementation. We improve mesh quality based on an extended lookup table
and modify the connectivity of some fundamental patterns in MC,
which effectively remove the reconstruction holes, thus improving
overall surface quality. As for the relative value between each
vertex and the average isovalue, the extended table explicitly
differentiates between “strictly larger” and “equal to”. Newly
introduced patterns in MC statistically prevent poor quality
triangles production. Moreover, a decision making algorithm is
proposed to eliminate ambiguity problems. We adapt SnapMC
algorithm to avoid non manifold triangles to a certain extent.
Comparisons with traditional Poisson algorithm and Smooth
Signed Distance (SSD) highlight the capability in quality mesh
generation and efficacy in handling high computational demand.
