analyzes a corpus of 4.5 million non-fork projects hosted on GitHub representing over 428 million iles written
in Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We found that this corpus has a mere 85 million unique iles. In other
words, 70% of the code on GitHub consists of clones of previously created iles. There is considerable variation
between language ecosystems. JavaScript has the highest rate of ile duplication, only 6% of the iles are distinct.
Java, on the other hand, has the least duplication, 60% of iles are distinct. Lastly, a project-level analysis shows
that between 9% and 31% of the projects contain at least 80% of iles that can be found elsewhere. These rates
of duplication have implications for systems built on open source software as well as for researchers interested
in analyzing large code bases. As a concrete artifact of this study, we have created DéjàVu, a publicly available
map of code duplicates in GitHub repositories.
