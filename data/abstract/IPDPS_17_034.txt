
Dynamic behavior is an essential part of wireless
networking, due mobility, environmental changes or failures.
We analyze a natural exponential backoff procedure to manage
contention in a fading channel, in the presence of both node churn
and link changes. We show that it attains a fast convergence,
stabilizing contention from any state in logarithmic time. We
use it to obtain optimal algorithm for Local Broadcast that even
improves known results for the static case. The results illustrate
the utility of carrier sensing, a stock feature of wireless nodes.
