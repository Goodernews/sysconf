
Monitoring and assessing the energy efficiency of
supercomputers and data centers is crucial in order to limit
and reduce their energy consumption. Applications from the
domain of High Performance Computing (HPC), such as MPI
applications, account for a significant fraction of the overall
energy consumed by HPC centers. Simulation is a popular
approach for studying the behavior of these applications in
a variety of scenarios, and it is therefore advantageous to
be able to study their energy consumption in a cost-efficient,
controllable, and also reproducible simulation environment. Alas,
simulators supporting HPC applications commonly lack the
capability of predicting the energy consumption, particularly
when target platforms consist of multi-core nodes. In this work,
we aim to accurately predict the energy consumption of MPI
applications via simulation. Firstly, we introduce the models
required for meaningful simulations: The computation model,
the communication model, and the energy model of the target
platform. Secondly, we demonstrate that by carefully calibrating
these models on a single node, the predicted energy consumption
of HPC applications at a larger scale is very close (within a
few percents) to real experiments. We further show how to
integrate such models into the SimGrid simulation toolkit. In
order to obtain good execution time predictions on multi-core
architectures, we also establish that it is vital to correctly account
for memory effects in simulation. The proposed simulator is
validated through an extensive set of experiments with wellknown HPC benchmarks. Lastly, we show the simulator can
be used to study applications at scale, which allows researchers
to save both time and resources compared to real experiments.
