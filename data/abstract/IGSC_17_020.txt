
To save the electrical energy in a household, it is
essential to monitor where and how the power is consumed. To
maximize the efficiency of energy conservation, it is necessary
to make the running power low in the power monitor system,
which the tradition systems pay less attention to. This paper
presents PowerAnalyzer, an energy-aware system for monitoring
running states and power of each household appliance plugged
into power line from a single point detection. PowerAnalyzer
takes steady-state current waveforms as the appliances signature,
and uses the deep neural network (DNN) models to infer the
running states and running power of household appliances.
We focus on the energy consumption of PowerAnalyzer itself.
The energy efficiency of PowerAnalyzer is optimized from these
aspects: Using dynamic time intervals to collect electric data,
replacing a cloud server with an edge node to process data, and
transmitting differential data over a low power wireless protocol.
The evaluation results show that PowerAnalyzer offers 3.45%
average power metering error and 98.38% average accuracy of
inferring running states of appliances. PowerAnalyzer draws less
than 247mW static power and 304mW peak power.
