a fast and scalable graph generator has become more important than
ever before due to lack of large-scale realistic graphs for evaluating
the performance of graph processing methods. Although there have
been proposed a number of methods to generate synthetic graphs,
they are not very efficient in terms of space and time complexities,
and so, cannot generate even trillion-scale graphs using a moderate
size cluster of commodity machines. Here, we propose an efficient and scalable disk-based graph generator, TrillionG that can
generate massive graphs in a short time only using a small amount
of memory. It can generate a graph of a trillion edges following
the RMAT or Kronecker models within two hours only using 10
PCs. We first generalize existing graph generation models to the
scope-based generation model, where RMAT and Kronecker correspond to two extremes. Then, we propose a new graph generation model called the recursive vector model, which compromises
two extremes, and so, solves the space and time complexity problems existing in RMAT and Kronecker. We also extend the recursive vector model so as to generate a semantically richer graph
database. Through extensive experiments, we have demonstrated
that TrillionG outperforms the state-of-the-art graph generators by
up to orders of magnitude.
