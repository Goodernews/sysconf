many different resolutions to support different devices
and contexts, incurring substantial capacity overheads.
One approach to alleviate these overheads is to resize
them at request time. However, this approach can be inefficient, as reading full-size source images for resizing
uses more bandwidth than reading pre-resized images.
We propose repurposing the progressive JPEG standard
and customizing the organization of image data to reduce
the bandwidth overheads of dynamic resizing. We show
that at a PSNR of 32 dB, dynamic resizing with progressive JPEG provides 2.5x read data savings over baseline
JPEG, and that progressive JPEG with customized encode parameters can further improve these savings (up
to 5.8x over the baseline). Finally, we characterize the
decode overheads of progressive JPEG to assess the feasibility of directly decoding progressive JPEG images on
energy-limited devices. Our approach does not require
modifications to current JPEG software stacks.
