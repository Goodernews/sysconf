for its performance before it is released. Performance analysis is usually done by (a) load testing of the application on
a testbed and (b) building a performance model of the application. While there are a plethora of Web load-generator
tools available, there are two problems with these tools: one,
the tests have to be configured manually, which can lead to a
time-consuming trial-and-error process until the desired performance charts in the appropriate load ranges are obtained;
and two, the load generator tools do not produce output
that is directly useful for creating a performance model of
the application. In this paper, we present AutoPerf, a load
generator tool designed to meet two distinct goals, named
capacity analysis and profiling. The goal of capacity analysis
is to run a comprehensive load test on a Web application, in
an appropriately chosen range, at a minimal number of load
levels, while still producing an accurate graph of throughput
and response time vs load levels. The goal of profiling is to
generate a detailed server resource usage profile per request
type, without instrumenting the application code. This data
(e.g. CPU execution time by Web server for one request) is
crucial for parameterizing performance models of the application. AutoPerf intelligently plans and configures its load
tests by using analytical results from queuing theory along
with some heuristics. Results show that AutoPerf is able to
run performance tests very efficiently while still producing
an accurate chart of performance metrics.
