attentions in the past several years. The state-of-the-art systems
have successfully achieved decimeter-level accuracies. However, the
high accuracy is acquired at the cost of dense access point (AP) deployment, employing large size of frequency bandwidths or specialpurpose radar signals which are not compatible with existing WiFi
protocol, limiting their practical deployments. This paper presents
the design and implementation of AWL, an accurate indoor localization system that enables a single WiFi AP to achieve decimeterlevel accuracy with only one channel hopping The key enabler of
the system is we novelly employ channel hopping to create virtual
antennas, without the need of adding more antennas or physically
move the antennas’ positions for a larger antenna array. We successfully utilize the widely known “bad” spatial aliasing to improve the
AoA estimation accuracy. A novel multipath suppression scheme
is also proposed to combat the severe multipath issue indoors. We
build a prototype of AWL on WARP software-defined radio platform. Comprehensive experiments manifest that AWL achieves a
median localization accuracy of 38 cm in a rich multipath indoor
environment with only a single AP equipped with 6 antennas. In a
small scale area, AWL is able to accurately track a moving device’s
trajectory, enabling applications such as writing/drawing in the air.
