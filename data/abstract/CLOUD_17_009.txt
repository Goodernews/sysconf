detecting identical files and storing only one instance of them.
While appealing to the storage providers, this deduplication
set-up raises various privacy concerns among clients. Various
techniques to retrofit content confidentiality in deduplication have
been studied in the literature. Nevertheless, data encryption alone
is insufficient to protect users’ privacy, for the ownership and
equality information of the outsourced data left unprotected may
have serious privacy implications. In this paper, we investigate a
three-tier architecture that saves bandwidth otherwise incurred
by server-side deduplication solutions, yet does not admit the
client-side deduplication’s leakage on file existence. Leveraging
trusted SGX-enabled processors, we construct the first privacypreserving data deduplication protocol that protects not only the
confidentiality, but also the ownership and equality information
of the outsourced data, offering better privacy guarantees in
comparison with existing works on secure data deduplication.
Our experiments show that the proposed protocol incurs low
performance overhead over conventional solutions that provide
weaker level of privacy protection.
