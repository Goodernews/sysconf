
We introduce a novel graph called a host-switch
graph, which consists of host vertices and switch vertices. Using
host-switch graphs, we formulate a graph problem called an
order/radix problem (ORP) for designing low end-to-end latency
interconnection networks. Our focus is on reducing the host-tohost average shortest path length (h-ASPL), since the shortest
path length between hosts in a host-switch graph corresponds
to the end-to-end latency of a network. We hence define ORP
as follows: given order (the number of hosts) and radix (the
number of ports per switch), find a host-switch graph with the
minimum h-ASPL. We demonstrate that the optimal number
of switches can mathematically be predicted. On the basis of
the prediction, we carry out a randomized algorithm to find a
host-switch graph with the minimum h-ASPL. Interestingly, our
solutions include a host-switch graph such that switches have
the different number of hosts. We then apply host-switch graphs
to interconnection networks and evaluate them practically. As
compared with the three conventional interconnection networks
(the torus, the dragonfly, and the fat-tree), we demonstrate that
our networks provide higher performance while the number of
switches can decrease.
