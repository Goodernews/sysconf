resource management, software-defined networking, and virtualized infrastructure to meet diverse requirements of cloud
computing. To fully realizing their capability in traffic engineering and flow-based bandwidth management, it is critical for the
switches to measure network traffic for both individual flows
between virtual machines and aggregate flows between clusters
of physical or virtual machines. This paper proposes a novel
hierarchical traffic measurement scheme for software-defined
datacenter networks. It measures both aggregate flows and
individual flows that are organized in a hierarchy with an arbitrary number of levels. The measurement is performed based
on a new concept of hierarchical virtual counter arrays, which
record each packet only once by updating a single counter,
yet the sizes of all flows that the packet belongs to will be
properly updated. We demonstrate that the new measurement
scheme not only supports hierarchical traffic measurement with
accuracy, but does so with memory efficiency, using a fewer
number of counters than the number of flows.
