
In situ workflows contain tasks that exchange messages composed of several data fields. However, a consumer task
may not necessarily need all the data fields from its producer.
For example, a molecular dynamics simulation can produce atom
positions, velocities, and forces; but some analyses require only
atom positions. The user should decide whether to specialize
the output of a producer task for a particular consumer and
get better performance or to send more data than required by
the consumer. The first option limits task portability, while the
second wastes resources. In this paper, we introduce contracts
for in situ tasks. A contract specifies for a producer each data
field available for output and for a consumer the data fields
needed as input. Comparing a producer and consumer contract
allows automatic selection of the data fields a producer has to
send for that consumer. We integrated our contracts mechanism
within Decaf, a middleware for building and executing in situ
workflows. Contracts enable to automatically extract at the
producer the data the consumer needs. We evaluate the cost and
performance of message extraction at runtime with both synthetic
examples and a real scientific workflow coupling a molecular
dynamics simulation with three different data analytics codes.
Our contract-based automatic data extraction removes the need
to specialize producers while entailing small overheads.
