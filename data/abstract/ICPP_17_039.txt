algorithms to enable users to visually explore network data.
Nowadays, networks easily consist of millions of nodes and
edges, resulting in hours of computation time to obtain a
readable graph layout on a typical workstation. Although these
machines usually do not have a very large number of CPU
cores, they can easily be equipped with Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs), opening up the possibility of exploiting hundreds
or even thousands of cores to counter the aforementioned
computational challenges. In this paper we introduce a novel
GPU framework for visualizing large real-world network data.
The main focus is on a GPU implementation of force-directed
graph layout algorithms, which are known to create high quality network visualizations. The proposed framework is used
to parallelize the well-known ForceAtlas2 algorithm, which
is widely used in many popular network analysis packages
and toolkits. The different procedures and data structures of
the algorithm are adjusted to the CUDA GPU architectureâ€™s
specifics in terms of memory coalescing, shared memory usage
and thread workload balance. To evaluate its performance, the
GPU implementation is tested using a diverse set of 38 different
large-scale real-world networks. This allows for a thorough
characterization of the parallelizable components of both forcedirected layout algorithms in general as well as the proposed
GPU framework as a whole. Experiments demonstrate how
the approach can efficiently process very large real-world
networks, showing overall speedup factors between 40x and
123 compared to existing CPU implementations. In practice,
this means that a network with 4 million nodes and 120 million
edges can be visualized in 14 minutes rather than 9 hours.
