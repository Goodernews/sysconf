
Aggressive network densification in next generation
cellular networks is accompanied by an increase of the system energy consumption and calls for more advanced power
management techniques in base stations. In this paper, we
present a novel proactive and decentralized power management
method for small cell base stations in a cache-enabled multitier heterogeneous cellular network. User contexts are utilized
to drive the decision of dynamically switching a small cell base
station between the active mode and the sleep mode to minimize
the total energy consumption. The online control problem is
formulated as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem. A
variational inference based Bayesian neural network is proposed
as the solution method, which implicitly finds a proper balance
between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results show
that the proposed solution can achieve up to 46.9% total energy
reduction compared to baseline algorithms in the high density
deployment scenario and has comparable performance to an
offline optimal solution.
