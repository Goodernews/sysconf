the path to Exascale. Through the use of accelerators they offer outstanding energy efficiency. The programming of these devices employs
the host-device model, which is suboptimal as CPU remains idle during
kernel executions, but still consumes energy. Making the CPU contribute
computing effort might improve the performance and energy consumption of the system. This paper analyses the advantages of this approach
and sets the limits of when its beneficial. The claims are supported by
a set of models that determine how to share a single data-parallel task
between the CPU and the accelerator for optimum performance, energy
consumption or efficiency. Interestingly, the models show that optimising performance does not always mean optimum energy or efficiency as
well. The paper experimentally validates the models, which represent an
invaluable tool for programmers when faced with the dilemma of whether
to distribute their workload in these systems.
