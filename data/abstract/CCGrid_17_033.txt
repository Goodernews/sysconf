with Hard Disk Drives (HDD) in Hybrid Storage Systems (HSS)
for Cloud environment. When it comes to storing data, some
placement strategies are used to find the best location (SSD
or HDD). These strategies should minimize the cost of data
placement while satisfying Service Level Objectives (SLO). This
paper presents two Cost based Object Placement Strategies
(COPS) for DBaaS objects in HSS: a Genetic based approach
(G-COPS) and an ad-hoc Heuristic approach (H-COPS) based
on incremental optimization. While G-COPS proved to be
closer to the optimal solution in case of small instances, HCOPS showed a better scalability as it approached the exact
solution even for large instances (by 10% in average). In
addition, H-COPS showed small execution times (few seconds)
even for large instances which makes it a good candidate to
be used in runtime. Both H-COPS and G-COPS performed
better than state-of-the-art solutions as they satisfied SLOs
while reducing the overall cost by more than 40% for problems
of small and large instances.
