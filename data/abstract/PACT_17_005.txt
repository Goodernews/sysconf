degrades as technology scales, which imposes large performance
and energy overheads. This problem, prolonged restore time
(PRT), has been identified by the DRAM industry as one of
three major scaling challenges.

This paper proposes DrMP, a novel fine-grained precisionaware DRAM restore scheduling approach, to mitigate PRT. The
approach exploits process variations (PVs) within and across
DRAM rows to save data with mixed precision. The paper
describes three variants of the approach: DrMP-A, DrMP-P,
and DrMP-U. DrMP-A supports approximate computing by
mapping important data bits to fast row segments to reduce
restore time for improved performance at a low application error
rate. DrMP-P pairs memory rows together to reduce the average
restore time for precise computing. DrMP-U combines DrMP-A
and DrMP-P to better trade performance, energy consumption,
and computation precision. Our experimental results show that,
on average, DrMP achieves 20% performance improvement
and 15% energy reduction over a precision-oblivious baseline.
Further, DrMP achieves an error rate less than 1% at the
application level for a suite of benchmarks, including applications
that exhibit unacceptable error rates under simple approximation
that does not differentiate the importance of different bits.
