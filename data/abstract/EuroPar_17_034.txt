
. In this article, performance expectations for MPI neighborhood collective operations are formulated as self-consistent performance
guidelines. A microbenchmark and an experimental methodology are
presented to assess these guidelines. Measurement results from a large,
InfiniBand-based cluster, the Vienna Scientific Cluster (VSC), as well
as from a small commodity cluster computer are shown and discussed
to illustrate the methodology and to gain first insights into the performance of current MPI implementations. Results show that the examined
libraries seem to be sensitive to the order in which topological neighbors are specified, and that in some cases Cartesian topologies can be
outperformed by simulating them with distributed graph topologies.
