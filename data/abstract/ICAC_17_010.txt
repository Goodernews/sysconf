
The feasibility of large-scale decentralized networks
for local computations, as an alternative to big data systems
that are often privacy-intrusive, expensive and serve exclusively
corporate interests, is usually questioned by network dynamics
such as node leaves, failures and rejoins in the network. This is
especially the case when decentralized computations performed
in a network, such as the estimation of aggregation functions,
e.g. summation, are linked to the actual nodes connected in
the network, for instance, counting the sum using input values
from only connected nodes. Reverse computations are required
to maintain a high aggregation accuracy when nodes leave or
fail. This paper introduces an autonomic agent-based model
for highly dynamic self-corrective networks using decentralized
reverse computations. The model is generic and equips the nodes
with the capability to disseminate connectivity status updates
in the network. Highly resilient agents to the dynamic network
migrate to remote nodes and orchestrate reverse computations
for each node leave or failure. In contrast to related work, no
other computational resources or redundancy are introduced.
The self-corrective model is experimentally evaluated using realworld data from a smart grid pilot project under highly dynamic
network adjustments that correspond to catastrophic events with
up to 50% of the nodes leaving the network. The model is highly
agile and modular and is applied to the large-scale decentralized
aggregation network of DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service, without major structural changes in its design and
operations. Results confirm the outstanding improvement in the
aggregation accuracy when self-corrective actions are employed
with a minimal increase in communication overhead.
