
The fat-tree topology is one of the most commonly used network
topologies in HPC systems. Vendors support several options that
can be configured when deploying fat-tree networks on production systems, such as link bandwidth, number of rails, number of
planes, and tapering. This paper showcases the use of simulations
to compare the impact of these design options on representative
production HPC applications, libraries, and multi-job workloads.
We present advances in the TraceR-CODES simulation framework
that enable this analysis and evaluate its prediction accuracy against
experiments on a production fat-tree network. In order to understand the impact of different network configurations on various
anticipated scenarios, we study workloads with different communication patterns, computation-to-communication ratios, and scaling
characteristics. Using multi-job workloads, we also study the impact of inter-job interference on performance and compare the
cost-performance tradeoffs.
