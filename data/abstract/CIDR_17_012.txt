
In this paper, we present an overview of the Myria stack for
big data management and analytics that we developed in the
database group at the University of Washington and that
we have been operating as a cloud service aimed at domain
scientists around the UW campus. We highlight Myriaâ€™s key
design choices and innovations and report on our experience
with using Myria for various data science use-cases.
