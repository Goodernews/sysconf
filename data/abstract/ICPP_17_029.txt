
Fast, accurate three dimensional reconstructions
of plasma equilibria, crucial for physics interpretation of
fusion data generated within confinement devices like stellarators/tokamaks, are computationally very expensive and
routinely require days, even weeks, to complete using serial
approaches. Here, we present a parallel implementation of the
three dimensional plasma reconstruction code, V3FIT. A formal
analysis to identify the performance bottlenecks and scalability
limits of this new parallel implementation, which combines
both task and data parallelism, is presented. The theoretical
findings are supported by empirical performance results on
several thousands of processor cores of a Cray XC30 supercomputer. Parallel V3FIT is shown to deliver over 40X speedup,
enabling fusion scientists to carry out three dimensional plasma
equilibrium reconstructions at unprecedented scales in only a
few hours (instead of in days/weeks) for the first time.
