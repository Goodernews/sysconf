
The network plays a key role in High-Performance
Computing (HPC) system efficiency. Unfortunately, current
HPC routing solutions are not application-aware, and therefore
cannot deal with the sudden HPC traffic bursts and their
resulting congestion peaks.
To address this problem, we introduce Routing Keys, a
scalable routing paradigm for HPC networks that decouples
intra- and inter-application flow contention. Our Application
Routing Key (ARK) algorithm proactively allows each self-aware
application to route its flows according to a predetermined
routing key, i.e., its own intra-application contention-free routing. In addition, in our Network Routing Key (NRK) algorithm, a
centralized scheduler chooses between several routing keys for
the communication phases of each application, and therefore
reduces inter-application contention while maintaining intraapplication contention-free routing and avoiding scalability
issues. Using extensive evaluations, we show that both ARK
and NRK significantly improve the communication runtime by
up to 2.7x.
