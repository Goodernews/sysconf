
. If large-scale quantum computers become commonplace, the operating system will have to provide novel
abstractions to capture the power of this bizarre new hardware. In this paper, we consider this and other systemslevel issues that quantum computers would raise, and we
demonstrate that these machines would offer surprising
speed-ups for a number of everyday systems tasks, such
as unit testing and CPU scheduling.
