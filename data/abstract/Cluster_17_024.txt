
In this paper, we present Justice, a fair-share
deadline-aware resource allocator for big data cluster managers.
In resource constrained environments, where resource contention
introduces significant execution delays, Justice outperforms the
popular existing fair-share allocator that is implemented as part
of Mesos and YARN. Justice uses deadline information supplied
with each job and historical job execution logs to implement
admission control. It automatically adapts to changing workload
conditions to assign enough resources for each job to meet
its deadline “just in time.’ We use trace-based simulation of
production YARN workloads to evaluate Justice under different
deadline formulations. We compare Justice to the existing fairshare allocation policy deployed on cluster managers like YARN
and Mesos and find that in resource-constrained settings, Justice
improves fairness, satisfies significantly more deadlines, and
utilizes resources more efficiently.
