
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture
has become the dominant architecture and is widely used in virtualization platforms. In NUMA-based cloud computing platform,
arbitrary topology of vCPUs and memory may cause significant
performance degradation for VMs, which introduces great challenges for virtual machine monitors (VMMs) to efficiently manage
the vCPUs and memory. Previous studies mainly sample the
characteristics of the vCPUs to indicate the optimizing strategies
to reduce the NUMA overheads in virtualization platforms. But
the typical periodical sampling methods have some deviations
with the real vCPU characteristics. This leads to the inaccurate
sampling and scheduling decisions for the optimizing strategies.

Motivated by the inaccuracy in sampling methods and scheduling decisions, we propose a fine-grained scheduler, named vScope,
which makes accurate scheduling decisions according to the
guest OS processes in the vCPUs, to improve the performance
of memory-intensive workloads in cloud platforms. In vScope,
the VMM identifies the guest OS processes in the vCPUs and
calculates the NUMA affinity of each process from the PMU
data. At the end of vCPUâ€™s scheduling cycle, the scheduler
appropriately schedules the vCPUs to their local NUMA node
to alleviate the unnecessary NUMA overhead. We implement
vScope in Xen-4.5.1 VMM and evaluate its effectiveness with some
memory-intensive benchmarks. The experimental results shows
that vScope can achieve up to 11.5% performance improvement
for these workloads when compared with the Credit scheduler
in Xen. Moreover, vScope only introduces limited overhead into
the system.
