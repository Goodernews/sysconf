constant factor. Many asymptotic improvements followed. Unfortunately, most of them have done so at the cost of very large, often
gigantic, hidden constants. Consequently, Strassen-Winograd’s
oO (n!°ee 7) algorithm often outperforms other matrix multiplication algorithms for all feasible matrix dimensions. The leading
coefficient of Strassen-Winograd’s algorithm was believed to be
optimal for matrix multiplication algorithms with 2 x 2 base case,
due to a lower bound of Probert (1976).

Surprisingly, we obtain a faster matrix multiplication algorithm,
with the same base case size and asymptotic complexity as StrassenWinograd’s algorithm, but with the coefficient reduced from 6
to 5. To this end, we extend Bodrato’s (2010) method for matrix
squaring, and transform matrices to an alternative basis. We prove a
generalization of Probert’s lower bound that holds under change of
basis, showing that for matrix multiplication algorithms with a 2x2
base case, the leading coefficient of our algorithm cannot be further
reduced, hence optimal. We apply our technique to other Strassenlike algorithms, improving their arithmetic and communication
costs by significant constant factors.
