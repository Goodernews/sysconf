of future extreme scale supercomputers. Researchers and system
practitioners rely on field-data studies to understand reliability
characteristics and plan for future HPC systems. In this work, we
compare and contrast the reliability characteristics of multiple largescale HPC production systems. Our study covers more than one
billion compute node hours across five different systems over a
period of 8 years. We confirm previous findings which continue to
be valid, discover new findings, and discuss their implications.
