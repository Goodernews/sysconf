
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers typically offer multiple service classes to deal with the wide variety
of users adopting this cloud computing model. In this scenario,
IaaS providers need to perform efficient admission control and
capacity planning in order to minimize infrastructure costs,
while fulfilling the different Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
defined for all service classes offered. However, most of the
previous work on this field consider a single resource dimension
— typically CPU — when making such management decisions.
We show that this approach will either increase infrastructure
costs due to over-provisioning, or violate SLOs due to lack
of capacity for the resource dimensions being ignored. To fill
this gap, we propose admission control and capacity planning
methods that consider multiple service classes and multiple
resource dimensions. Our results show that our admission
control method can guarantee a high availability SLO fulfillment in scenarios where both CPU and memory can become
the bottleneck resource. Moreover, we show that our capacity
planning method can find the minimum capacity required for
both CPU and memory to meet SLOs with good accuracy. We
also analyze how the load variation on one resource dimension
can affect another, highlighting the need to manage resources
for multiple dimensions simultaneously.
