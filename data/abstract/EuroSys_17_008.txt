performance. At the core of MiniCrypt is an observation on
data compressibility trends in key-value stores, which enables grouping key-value pairs into small key packs, together
with a set of distributed systems techniques for retrieving,
updating, merging and splitting encrypted packs. Our evaluation shows that MiniCrypt compresses data by as much
as 4 times with respect to the vanilla key-value store, and
can increase the serverâ€™s throughput by up to two orders of
magnitude by fitting more data in main memory.
