problem. However current techniques have fundamental performance and concurrency limitations for update-heavy workloads. In
this paper, we investigate the potential advantages of deferred and
batched verification rather than the per-operation verification used in
prior work. We present Concerto, a comprehensive key-value store
designed around this idea. Using Concerto, we argue that deferred
verification preserves the utility of online verification and improves
concurrency resulting in orders-of-magnitude performance improvement. On standard benchmarks, the performance of Concerto is
within a factor of two when compared to state-of-the-art key-value
stores without integrity.
