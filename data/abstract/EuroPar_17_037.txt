
. In parallel database systems, data is partitioned and replicated across multiple independent nodes to improve system performance
and increase robustness. In current practice of database partitioning
design, all replicas are uniformly partitioned, however, different statements may prefer contradictory partitioning plans, so a single plan cannot achieve the overall optimal performance for the workload.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach of replica-aware data partitioning design to address the contradictions. According to the access
graph of SQL statements, we use the k-medoids algorithm to classify
workload into statement clusters, then we use the branch-and-bound
algorithm to search for the optimal partitioning plan for each cluster.
Finally, we organize replicas with these plans, and route statements to
their preferred replicas. We use TPC-E, TPC-H and National College
and University Enrollment System (NACUES) to evaluate our approach.
The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach improves system
performance by up to 4x over the current practice of partitioning design.
