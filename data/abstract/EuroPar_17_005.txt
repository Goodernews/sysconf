Platforms, both built on a NVIDIA Tegra System on Chip and combining a quad-core ARM CPU and an NVIDIA GPU. Their heterogeneous
nature, as well as their wide operating frequency range, make it hard
for application developers to reason about performance and determine
which optimizations are worth pursuing. This paper attempts to inform
developers’ choices by characterizing the platforms’ performance using
Roofline models obtained through an empirical measurement-based approach as well as through a case study of a heterogeneous application
(matrix multiplication). Our results highlight a difference of more than
an order of magnitude in compute performance between the CPU and
GPU on both platforms. Given that the CPU and GPU share the same
memory bus, their Roofline models’ balance poinis are also more than
an order of magnitude apart. We also explore the impact of frequency
scaling: build CPU and GPU Roofline profiles and characterize both platforms’ balance point variation, power consumption, and performance per
watt as frequency is scaled.

The characterization we provide can be used in two main ways. First,
given an application, it can inform the choice and number of processing
elements to use (i.e., CPU/GPU and number of cores) as well as the
optimizations likely to lead to high performance gains. Secondly, this
characterization indicates that developers can use frequency scaling to
tune the Jetson Platform to suit the requirements of their applications.
Third, given a required power/performance budget, application developers can identify the appropriate parameters to use to tune the Jetson
platforms to their specific workload requirements. We expect that this
optimization approach can lead to overall gains in performance and/or
power efficiency without requiring application changes.
