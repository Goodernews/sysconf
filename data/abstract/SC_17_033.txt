
Modern HPC centers comprise clusters, storage, networks, power
and cooling infrastructure, and more. Analyzing the efficiency
of these complex facilities is a daunting task. Increasingly, facilities deploy sensors and monitoring tools, but with millions of
instrumented components, analyzing collected data manually is
intractable. Data from an HPC center comprises different formats,
granularities, and semantics, and handwritten scripts no longer
suffice to transform the data into a digestible form.

We present ScrubJay, an intuitive, scalable framework for automatic analysis of disparate HPC data. ScrubJay decouples the task
of specifying data relationships from the task of analyzing data.
Domain experts can store reusable transformations that describe
relations between domains. ScrubJay also automates performance
analysis. Analysts provide a query over logical domains of interest, and ScrubJay automatically derives needed steps to transform
raw measurements. ScrubJay makes large-scale analysis tractable,
reproducible, and provides insights into HPC facilities.
