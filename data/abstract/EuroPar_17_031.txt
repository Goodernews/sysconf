
. Energy efficiency in data centres is addressed through workload management usually to reduce the operational costs and as a byproduct, the environmental footprint. This includes to minimise total
power consumption or to minimise the power issued from non-renewable
energy sources. Hence, the performance requirements of the clientâ€™s applications are either totally overlooked or strictly enforced.

To encourage profitable sustainability in data centres, we consider the
total financial gain as a trade-off between energy efficiency and client
satisfaction. We propose Carver to orchestrate energy-adaptive applications, according to performance and environmental preferences and
given forecasts of the renewable energy production. We validated Carver
by simulating a testbed powered by the grid and a photovoltaic array
and running the Web service HP LIFE.
