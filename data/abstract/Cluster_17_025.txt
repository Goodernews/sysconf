
Burst buffers tolerate I/O spikes in HighPerformance Computing environments by using a non-volatile
flash technology. Burst buffers are commonly located between
parallel file systems and compute nodes, handling bursty I/Os
in the middle. In this architecture, burst buffers are shared
resources. The performance of an SSD is significantly reduced
when it is used excessively because of garbage collection, and
we have observed that SSDs in a burst buffer become slow when
many users simultaneously use the burst buffer. To mitigate the
performance problem, we propose a new user-level I/O isolation
framework in a High-Performance Computing environment
using a multi-streamed SSD. The multi-streamed SSD allocates
the same flash block for I/Os in the same stream. We assign
a different stream to each user; thus, the user can use the
stream exclusively. To evaluate the performance, we have used
open-source supercomputing workloads and I/O traces from
real workloads in the Cori supercomputer at the National
Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. Via user-level
I/O isolation, we have obtained up to a 125% performance
improvement in terms of I/O throughput. In addition, our
approach reduces the write amplification in the SSDs, leading
to improved SSD endurance. This user-level I/O isolation
framework could be applied to deployed burst buffers without
having to make any user interface changes.
