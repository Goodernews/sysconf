
Hierarchical data representations have been
shown to be effective tools for coping with large-scale scientific
data. Writing hierarchical data on supercomputers, however,
is challenging as it often involves all-to-one communication
during aggregation of low-resolution data which tends to span
the entire network domain, resulting in several bottlenecks. We
introduce the concept of indexing templates, which succinctly
describe data organization and can be used to alter movement of data in beneficial ways. We present two techniques,
domain partitioning and localized aggregation, that leverage
indexing templates to alleviate congestion and synchronization
overheads during data aggregation. We report experimental
results that show significant I/O speedup using our proposed
schemes on two of todayâ€™s fastest supercomputers, Mira and
Shaheen II, using the Uintah and S3D simulation frameworks.
