over the web. Facilitated by the proliferation of online marketplaces that bring such users together, data brokers need
to serve requests where they provide results for user queries
over the underlying datasets, and price them fairly according
to the information disclosed by the query. In this work, we
present a novel pricing system, called QIRANA, that performs
query-based data pricing for a large class of SQL queries (including aggregation) in real time. QIRANA provides prices
with formal guarantees: for example, it avoids prices that
create arbitrage opportunities. Our framework also allows
flexible pricing, by allowing the data seller to choose from a
variety of pricing functions, as well as specify relation and
attribute-level parameters that control the price of queries
and assign different value to different portions of the data.
We test QIRANA on a variety of real-world datasets and
query workloads, and we show that it can efficiently compute
the prices for queries over large-scale data.
