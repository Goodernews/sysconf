many supercomputers. Lustre is one of the most used parallel file systems, and its enhanced file system named FEFS (Fujitsu Exabyte File
System) has been used at K computer. The K computer has adopted twolayered file system consisting of a local file system and a shared global
file system with data staging scheme in order to guarantee sufficient I/O
throughput on the local file system during computation. However, huge
data staging on the shared file system sometimes has led to big I/O
interference in light-weight file accesses which have taken place at the
same time. Alleviation of such I/O interference on shared file systems
is an important issue in managing a big scale of parallel file systems in
shared use. In this paper, we focus on I/O interference alleviation by
using workload-aware striping and load-balancing. Appropriate striping
configuration with effective load-balancing in service thread allocation
for incoming I/O requests has improved performance of light-weight file
accesses against huge data accesses without excessive sacrifice to data
staging performance at the K computer. It is expected that the proposed
optimization can be used as a system-wide I/O interference mitigation
approach.
