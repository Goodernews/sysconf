by protein-protein interactions since they form cells and control
function mechanisms. Thus, identifying pairs of protein-protein
interactions would be very useful, but it is not an easy task. But,
doing a wet lab consumes huge amount of resources whereas
using computational methods is highly challenging since they
may introduce high false positives. Since a protein is a sequence
of amino acids, a protein interaction would be influenced by
some interactions of amino acids, and the identification of
outstanding interacting pairs would give insightful meaning into
how a pair of proteins interacts.

This paper proposes a novel method to analyze a set of wellknown protein-protein interactions for identifying a set of strong
amino acid pairs that may influence the interaction. We calculate
amino acid correlation values via Pearsonâ€™s correlation, and use
K-means clustering to group a set of outstanding amino acid
pairs based on correlation values. The experimental results for 10
sets of protein interaction networks can identify a number of
strong amino acid pairs among them.
