users can easily notice the undesired fast battery drain, it is
almost impossible for them to precisely remember how the
abnormal battery drain (ABD) is triggered, making it difficult for
developers to fix the problem. Therefore, app developers are in an
urgent need for a tool that can provide them helpful information.

In this paper, we propose eDelta, a framework that assists
developers in pinpointing the APIs with high energy deviation,
which usually have a high probability of being relevant to the nondeterministic ABD. Specifically, eDelta performs comparative
trace analysis to identify APIs that have significant energy consumption deviation in different user traces. With the information
provided by eDelta, developers can substantially reduce the
time they spend searching for the ABD root causes. We have
prototyped eDelta in Android 4.4 and evaluated it with twenty
real-world apps. Our results show that eDelta can effectively
pinpoint the APIs with high energy deviation and those APIs
indeed cause ABD. Specifically, it reduces, on average, 94.6% of
the amount of code that the developers would need to search for
ABD root causes.
