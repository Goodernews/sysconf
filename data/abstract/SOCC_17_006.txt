accentuated storage performance as a critical bottleneck. Although cache replacement algorithms have been extensively
studied, cache prefetching — reducing latency by retrieving
items before they are actually requested — remains an underexplored area. Existing approaches to history-based prefetching,
in particular, provide too few benefits for real systems for the
resources they cost.

We propose MITHRIL, a prefetching layer that efficiently

exploits historical patterns in cache request associations. MITHRIL

is inspired by sporadic association rule mining and only relies on the timestamps of requests. Through evaluation of
135 block-storage traces, we show that MITHRIL is effective,
giving an average of a 55% hit ratio increase over LRU and
PROBABILITY GRAPH, and a 36% hit ratio gain over AMP
at reasonable cost. Finally, we demonstrate the improvement
comes from MITHRIL being able to capture mid-frequency
blocks.
