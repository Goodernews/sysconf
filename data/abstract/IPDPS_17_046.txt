
Data have been generated and collected at an
accelerating pace. Hadoop has made analyzing large scale
data much simpler to developers/analysts using commodity
hardware. Interestingly, it has been shown that most Hadoop
jobs have small input size and do not run for long time. For
example, higher level query languages, such as Hive and Pig,
would handle a complex query by breaking it into smaller adhoc ones. Although Hadoop is designed for handling complex
queries with large data sets, we found that it is highly inefficient
to operate at small scale data, despite a new Uber mode was
introduced specifically to handle jobs with small input size.

In this paper, we propose an optimized Hadoop extension
called MRapid, which significantly speeds up the execution of
short jobs. It is completely backward compatible to Hadoop,
and imposes negligible overhead. Our experiments on Microsoft
Azure public cloud show that MRapid can improve performance by up to 88% compared to the original Hadoop.
