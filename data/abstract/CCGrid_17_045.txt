
Energy consumption has become one of the most
critical issues in the evolution of High Performance Computing
systems (HPC). Controlling the energy consumption of HPC
platforms is not only a way to control the cost but also a step
forward on the road towards exaflops. Powercapping is a widely
studied technique that guarantees that the platform will not
exceed a certain power threshold instantaneously but it gives
no flexibility to adapt job scheduling to a longer term energy
budget control.

We propose a job scheduling mechanism that extends the
backfilling algorithm to become energy-aware. Simultaneously,
we adapt resource management with a node shutdown technique to minimize energy consumption whenever needed. This
combination enables an efficient energy consumption budget
control on a cluster during a period of time. The technique is
experimented, validated and compared with various alternatives
through extensive simulations. Experimentation results show high
system utilization and limited bounded slowdown along with
interesting outcomes in energy efficiency while respecting an
energy budget during a particular time period.
