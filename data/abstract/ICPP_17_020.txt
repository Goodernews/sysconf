
We present parallel algorithms for computing
cycle orders and cycle perimeters in relative neighborhood
graphs. This parallel algorithm has wide-ranging applications from microscopic to macroscopic domains, e.g.,
in histopathological image analysis and wireless network
routing. Our algorithm consists of the following steps (subalgorithms): (1) Uniform partitioning of the graph vertices
across processes, (2) Parallel Delaunay triangulation and
(3) Parallel computation of the relative neighborhood
graph and the cycle orders and perimeters. We evaluated
our algorithm on a large dataset with 6.5 Million points
and demonstrate excellent fixed-size scalability. We also
demonstrate excellent isogranular scalability up to 131K
processes. Our largest run was on a dataset with 13 billion
points on 131K processes on ORNL’s Cray XK7 “Titan”
supercomputer.
