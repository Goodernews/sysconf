Internet inter-connection. To facilitate the exchange of routes
amongst their members, IXPs provide Route Server (RS) services to dispatch the routes according to each member’s peering policies. Nowadays, to make use of RSes, these policies
must be disclosed to the IXP. This poses fundamental questions regarding the privacy guarantees of route-computation
on confidential business information. Indeed, as evidenced by
interaction with IXP administrators and a survey of network
operators, this state of affairs raises privacy concerns among
network administrators and even deters some networks from
subscribing to RS services. We design sIxPACK, an RS service
that leverages Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) to
keep peering policies confidential, while extending, the functionalities of today’s RSes. As SMPC is notoriously heavy
in terms of communication and computation, our design
and implementation of srxpack aims at moving computation outside of the SMPC without compromising the privacy
guarantees. We assess the effectiveness and scalability of
our system by evaluating a prototype implementation using
traces of data from one of the largest IXPs in the world. Our
evaluation results indicate that srxpAck can scale to support
privacy-preserving route-computation, even at IXPs with
many hundreds of member networks.
