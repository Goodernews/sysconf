
The increasing use of databases in the storage of critical and
sensitive information in many organizations has lead to an
increase in the rate at which databases are exploited in computer crimes. While there are several techniques and tools
available for database forensics, they mostly assume apriori
database preparation, such as relying on tamper-detection
software to be in place or use of detailed logging. Investigators, alternatively, need forensic tools and techniques that
work on poorly-configured databases and make no assumptions about the extent of damage in a database.
In this paper, we present DBCarver, a tool for reconstructing database content from a database image without using
any log or system metadata. The tool uses page carving
to reconstruct both query-able data and non-queryable data
(deleted data). We describe how the two kinds of data can
be combined to enable a variety of forensic analysis questions
hitherto unavailable to forensic investigators. We show the
generality and efficiency of our tool across several databases
through a set of robust experiments.
