
Maximizing bandwidth utilization of optical on
chip interconnects is essential to compensate for static power
overheads in optical networks-on-chip. Shared optical buses were
shown to be a power-efficient, modular design solution with
tremendous power saving potential by allowing optical bandwidth
to be shared by all connected nodes. Previous proposals resolve
bus contention by scheduling senders sequentially on the entire
optical bandwidth; however, logically splitting a bus into subchannels to allow both sequential and parallel data transmission
has been shown to be highly efficient in electrical interconnects
and could also be applied to shared optical buses.
In this paper, we propose an efficient subchannel scheduling
algorithm that aims to minimize the number of bus utilization
cycles by assigning sender-receiver pairs both to subchannels and
time slots. We present both a distributed and a centralized bus
arbitration scheme and show that both can be implemented with
low overheads. Our results show that subchannel scheduling can
more than double throughput on shared optical buses compared
to sequential scheduling without any power overheads in most
cases. Arbitration latency overheads compared to state-of-theart sequential schemes are moderate-to-low for significant bus
bandwidths and only noticeable for low injection rates.
