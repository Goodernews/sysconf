several types of workloads, and some cloud clients prefer a
single-tenant environment due to the lower security vulnerability of such enviornments. However, as the bare-metal
cloud does not utilize a virtualization layer, it cannot use
live migration. Thus, there is a lack of manageability with
the bare-metal cloud. Live migration support can improve
the manageability of bare-metal cloud services significantly.

This paper suggests an on-demand virtualization technique
to improve the manageability of bare-metal cloud services.
A thin virtualization layer is inserted into the bare-metal
cloud when live migration is requested. After the completion
of the live migration process, the thin virtualization layer is
removed from the host. We modified BitVisor [19] to implement on-demand virtualization and live migration on the x86
architecture.

The elapsed time of on-demand virtualization was negligible. It takes about 20 ms to insert the virtualization layer and
30 ms to remove the one. After removing the virtualization
layer, the host machine works with bare-metal performance.
