analysis: before any analysis can be done, data from a variety of sources must be wrangled into a uniform format
that is amenable to the intended analysis and analytical
software package. This data transformation task is tedious,
time-consuming, and often requires programming skills beyond the expertise of data analysts. In this paper, we develop
a technique to synthesize data transformation programs by
example, reducing this burden by allowing the analyst to describe the transformation with a small input-output example
pair, without being concerned with the transformation steps
required to get there. We implemented our technique in a
system, FOOFAH, that efficiently searches the space of possible data transformation operations to generate a program
that will perform the desired transformation. We experimentally show that data transformation programs can be created
quickly with FooFAH for a wide variety of cases, with 60%
less user effort than the well-known WRANGLER system.
