data availability, reliability, and optimized performance in
distributed storage systems and data centers. In recent years,
with the emergence of new storage devices, heterogeneous
object-based storage system, such as a storage system with
the co-existence of hard disk drives and solid state drives,
have become increasingly attractive as they combine merits of
different storage devices to deliver better promise. However,
existing data replication schemes do not place data based
on heterogeneous device characteristics as well as considering
distinct data access patterns. In this paper, we introduce a
novel data replication scheme PRS to achieve efficient data
replication for heterogeneous storage systems. Different from
traditional schemes, the PRS groups objects according to
data access patterns and distributes replicas to heterogeneous
devices with their features. It uses a pseudo random algorithm
to optimize replica layout by considering storage device performance and capacity. The experimental results confirm that
PRS is a highly efficient replication scheme for heterogeneous
storage systems.
