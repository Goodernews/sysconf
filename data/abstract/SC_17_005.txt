
Data services such as search, discovery, and management in scalable
distributed environments have traditionally been decoupled from
the underlying file systems, and are often deployed using external
databases and indexing services. However, modern data production
rates, looming data movement costs, and the lack of metadata,
entail revisiting the decoupled file system-data services design
philosophy.

In this paper, we present Taglt, a scalable data management
service framework aimed at scientific datasets, which is tightly integrated into a shared-nothing distributed file system. A key feature
of Taglt is a scalable, distributed metadata indexing framework,
using which we implement a flexible tagging capability to support
data discovery. The tags can also be associated with an active operator, for pre-processing, filtering, or automatic metadata extraction,
which we seamlessly offload to file servers in a load-aware fashion.
Our evaluation shows that TagIt can expedite data search by up to
10x over the extant decoupled approach.
