maximal load of a system with guaranteed bounds for response times and delays. These quantities are specified for
single services which are combined in a service oriented architecture (SOA) to composed services offered to potential
users or other service providers. To derive SLAs for composed services and to plan the required capacity to guarantee SLAs, appropriate methods and tools have to be used
that compute results based on information given in SLAs.
In this paper it is argued that most available approaches
are not sufficient to analyze systems based on SLA information. A new method and a tool are presented that support
the efficient calculation of bounds for delays in composed
systems based on bounds for the load and the delay of the
individual components which are specified in the SLAs of
the components. Furthermore, the presented tool can be
used to generate bounds for the required processing capacity which a provider has to provide in order to guarantee the
quality of service defined in the SLAs.

The presented approach is in some sense a counterpart
to mean value analysis for queueing networks but rather
than mean values, worst case bounds for different quantities
like response times or departure processes are computed.
Analysis is based on min/+ algebra but the mathematical
approach is hidden from the user by a graphical interface
allowing a simple graphical specification and result representation for networks of composed services.
