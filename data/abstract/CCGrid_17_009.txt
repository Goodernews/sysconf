
Troubleshooting in an infrastructure-as-a-Service
daaS) cloud platform is an inherently difficult task because it is
a multi-player as well as multi-layer environment where tenant
and provider effectively share administrative duties. To address
these concerns, we present our work on CloudSight in which
cloud providers allow tenants greater system-wide visibility
through a transparency-as-a-service abstraction. We present
the design, implementation, and evaluation of CloudSight in
the OpenStack cloud platform. We also develop two example
applications that make use of the CloudSight abstraction and
use the applications to explore real cloud problems.
