Layers of abstraction and virtualization allow flexible
and scalable deployment. But they also introduce complications if one wants predictable performance and easy
trouble-shooting. We propose to support the designers,
testers, and maintainers of such systems by annotating
system components with performance models. Our goal
is to formulate annotations that can be used as oracles
in performance testing, that can provide valuable guidance for debugging, and that can also inform designers
by predicting the performance profile of an assembly of
annotated components. We present an initial formulation
of such annotations together with their concrete derivation from the execution of a complex web service.
