
There is currently a lack of Requirements Engineering (RE)
approaches applied to, or supporting, the development of
a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) taking into account the
environment in which it is to be used. We present a modelbased RE approach to support DSL development with a focus
on usability concerns. RDAL is a RE fragment language that
can be complemented with other languages to support RE
and design. USE-ME is a model driven approach for DSLs
usability evaluation which is integrable with a DSL development approach. We combine RDAL and a new DSL, named
DSSL, that we created for the specification of DSL-based
systems. Integrated with this combination we add USE-ME
to support usability evaluation. This combination of existing
languages and tools provides a comprehensive RE approach
for DSL development. We illustrate the approach with the
development of the Gyro DSL for programming robots.
