on co-scheduling independent jobs on integrated CPU-GPU
systems with power caps considered. It reveals the performance
degradations caused by the co-run contentions at the levels of
both memory and power. It then examines the problem of
using job co-scheduling to alleviate the degradations in this
less understood scenario. It offers several algorithms and a
lightweight co-run performance and power predictive model
for computing the performance bounds of the optimal coschedules and finding appropriate schedules. Results show that
the method can efficiently find co-schedules that significantly
improve the system throughput (9-46% on average over the
default schedules).
