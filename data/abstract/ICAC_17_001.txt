by cloud-deployed VM clusters. Although economical, VMs in the
cloud are prone to interference due to contention for physical
resources among colocated users. Worse, this interference is
dynamic and unpredictable. Current provider-centric solutions
are application-oblivious and are thus not always aware of the
user’s SLO requirements or application bottlenecks. Further,
such solutions rely on VM scheduling and migration, approaches
that are not agile enough to mitigate volatile interference.

This paper presents DIAL, an interference-aware load balancer that can be employed by cloud users without requiring any assistance from the provider. DIAL addresses timevarying interference by dynamically shifting load away from
compromised VMs without violating the application’s tail latency
SLOs. The key idea behind DIAL is to infer the demand for
contended resources on the physical hosts, which is otherwise
hidden from users. Estimates of the colocated load are then
used to drive the load distribution for the application VMs.
Our experimental results on OpenStack and AWS clouds show
that DIAL can reduce application tail latencies by as much as
70% and 48% compared to interference-oblivious and existing
interference-aware load balancers, respectively.
