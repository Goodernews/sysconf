and algorithms require efficient group-communication on computing systems with failing nodes. Existing reliable broadcast
algorithms either cannot guarantee that all nodes are reached
or are very expensive in terms of the number of messages
and latency. This paper proposes Corrected-Gossip, a method
that combines Monte Carlo style gossiping with a deterministic
correction phase, to construct a Las Vegas style reliable
broadcast that guarantees reaching all the nodes at low cost.
We analyze the performance of this method both analytically
and by simulations and show how it reduces the latency and
network load compared to existing algorithms. Our method
improves the latency by 20% and the network load by 53%
compared to the fastest known algorithm on 4,096 nodes. We
believe that the principle of corrected-gossip opens an avenue
for many other reliable group communication operations.
