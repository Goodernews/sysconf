
A heterogeneous memory system (HMS) consists of
multiple memory components with different properties. GPU is a
representative architecture with HMS. It is challenging to decide
optimal placement of data objects on HMS because of the large
exploration space and complicated memory hierarchy on HMS.
In this paper, we introduce performance modeling techniques
to predict performance of various data placements on GPU. In
essence, our models quantify and capture implicit performance
correlation between different data placements. Given the memory
access information and performance of a sample data placement,
our models predict performance for other data placements based
on the quantified correlation. We reveal critical performance
factors that cause performance variation across data placements.
Those factors include instruction replay, addressing mode, hardware queuing delay of memory requests, off-chip memory access
latency, and caching effects. Those factors, which are often not
sufficiently considered in the existing performance models, can
significantly impact modeling accuracy. We introduce a series
of techniques to model those factors. We extensively evaluate
our models with a variety of benchmarks with various data
placements. Our models are able to quantitatively predict the
benefit or performance loss of data placements.
