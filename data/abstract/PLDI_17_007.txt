
Precise dynamic data race detectors provide strong correctness guarantees but have high overheads because they generally keep analysis state in a separate shadow location for each
heap memory location, and they check (and potentially update) the corresponding shadow location on each heap access.
The B IG F OOT dynamic data race detector uses a combination
of static and dynamic analysis techniques to coalesce checks
and compress shadow locations. With B IG F OOT, multiple
accesses to an object or array often induce a single coalesced
check that manipulates a single compressed shadow location,
resulting in a performance improvement over FAST T RACK
of 61%.
