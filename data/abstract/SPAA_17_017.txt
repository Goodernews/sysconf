ensuring good throughput of the jobs, and ensuring that not too
much cost is spent on machine calibration.

In this paper we examine flow time as a metric for scheduling
with calibrations. While previous papers guaranteed that jobs would
meet a certain deadline, we relax that constraint to a tradeoff: we
want to balance how long the average job waits with how many
costly calibrations we need to perform.

One advantage of this metric is that it allows for online schedules
(where an algorithm is unaware of a job until it arrives). Thus we
give two types of results. We give an efficient offline algorithm
which gives the optimal schedule on a single machine for a set
of jobs which are known ahead of time. We also give online algorithms which adapt to jobs as they come. Our online algorithms
are constant competitive for unweighted jobs on single or multiple
machines, and constant-competitive for weighted jobs on a single
machine.
