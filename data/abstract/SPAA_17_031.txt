In this paper, we introduce revocable reservations, a transactional
memory mechanism to reserve locations in one transaction and
check whether they are unchanged in a subsequent transaction
without preventing reserved locations from being reclaimed in the
interim. We describe several implementations of revocable reservations, and show how to use revocable reservations to implement
lists and trees with a transactional analog to hand-over-hand locking. Our evaluation of these data structures shows that revocable
reservations allow precise and immediate reclamation within transactional data structures, without sacrificing scalability or introducing excessive latency.
