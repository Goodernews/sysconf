
This paper addresses energy efficient VNF placement and chaining over NFV enabled infrastructures. VNF
placement and chaining are formulated as a decision tree search
to overcome this NP-Hard problem complexity. The proposed
approach is an extension of the Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) method to achieve energy savings using physical
resource consolidation and sharing VNFs between multiple
tenants. A real cloud testbed and extensive simulations are
used to assess performance and ability to scale with problem
size. Evaluation results show significant reduction in energy
consumption of the proposed placement solution compared to
related work. The polynomial complexity of our proposal is
highlighted by the simulation results.
