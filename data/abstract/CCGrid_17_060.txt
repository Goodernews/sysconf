schedulers come with various configurable parameters for the
queues which can be adjusted based on the requirements of
the system. The employed configuration affects both system
utilization and job response times. Often times, choosing an
optimal configuration with good performance is not straightforward and requires good knowledge of the system behavior to
various kinds of workloads. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
scheme for setting queue configurations, namely, the number of
queues, partitioning of the processor space and the mapping of
the queues to the processor partitions, and the processor size
and execution time limits corresponding to the queues based
on the historical workload patterns. We use a novel non-linear
programming formulation for partitioning and mapping of nodes
to the queues for homogeneous HPC systems. We also propose
a novel hybrid partitioned-nonpartitioned scheme for allocating
processors to the jobs submitted to the queues. Our simulation
results for a supercomputer system with 35,000+ CPU cores show
that our hybrid scheme gives up to 74% reduction in queue
waiting times and up to 12% higher utilizations than static queue
configurations.
