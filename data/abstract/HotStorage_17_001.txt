network-level efficiency of cloud storage services (e.g.,
Dropbox). Practical delta sync techniques are, however, only available for PC clients and mobile apps,
but not web browsers—the most pervasive and OSindependent access method. To understand obstacles of
web-based delta sync, we implemented a traditional delta
sync solution (named WebRsync) for web browsers using JavaScript, and find that WebRsync severely suffers
from the inefficiency of JavaScript execution inside web
browsers, thus leading to frequent stagnation and even
crashing. Given that the computation burden on the web
browser mainly stems from data chunk search and comparison, we reverse the traditional delta sync approach by
lifting all chunk search and comparison operations from
the client side into the server side. Inevitably, this brings
enormous computation overhead to the servers. Hence,
we further leverage locality matching and a more efficient checksum to reduce the overhead. The resulting
solution (called WebR2sync+) outpaces WebRsync by
an order of magnitude, and it is able to simultaneously
support ~7300 web clients’ delta sync using an ordinary
VM server based on a Dropbox-like system architecture.
