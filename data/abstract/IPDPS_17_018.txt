of leader election in the mobile telephone model: a recently
introduced variation of the classical telephone model modified
to better describe the local peer-to-peer communication services
implemented in many popular smartphone operating systems.
In more detail, the mobile telephone model differs from the
classical telephone model in three ways: (1) each device can
participate in at most one connection per round; (2) the
network topology can undergo a parameterized rate of change;
and (3) devices can advertise a parameterized number of bits
to their neighbors in each round before connection attempts
are initiated. We begin by describing and analyzing a new
leader election algorithm in this model that works under the
harshest possible parameter assumptions: maximum rate of
topology changes and no advertising bits. We then apply this
result to resolve an open question from [1] on the efficiency of
PUSH-PULL rumor spreading under these conditions. We then
turn our attention to the slightly easier case where devices can
advertise a single bit in each round. We demonstrate a large
gap in time complexity between these zero bit and one bit cases.
In more detail, we describe and analyze a new algorithm that
solves leader election with a time complexity that includes the
parameter bounding topology changes. For all values of this
parameter, this algorithm is faster than the previous result,
with a gap that grows quickly as the parameter increases
(indicating lower rates of change). We conclude by describing
and analyzing a modified version of this algorithm that does
not require the assumption that all devices start during the
same round. This new version has a similar time complexity
(the rounds required differ only by a polylogarithmic factor),
but now requires slightly larger advertisement tags.
