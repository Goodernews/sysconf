
Demand response refers to reducing energy consumption of participating systems in response to transient surge
in power demand or other emergency events. Demand response is
particularly important for maintaining power grid transmission
stability, as well as achieving overall energy saving. High Performance Computing (HPC) systems can be considered as ideal
participants for demand-response programs, due to their massive
energy demand. However, the potential loss of performance
must be weighed against the possible gain in power system
stability and energy reduction. In this paper, we explore the
opportunity of demand response on HPC systems by proposing a
new HPC job scheduling and resource provisioning model. More
specifically, the proposed model applies power-bound energyconservation job scheduling during the critical demand-response
events, while maintaining the traditional performance-optimized
job scheduling during the normal period. We expect such a
model can attract willing participation of the HPC systems in
the demand response programs, as it can improve both power
stability and energy saving without significantly compromising
application performance. We implement the proposed method
in a simulator and compare it with the traditional scheduling
approach. Using trace-driven simulation, we demonstrate that
the HPC demand response is a viable approach toward power
stability and energy savings with only marginal increase in the
jobsâ€™ execution time.
