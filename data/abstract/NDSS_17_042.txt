
Covert channels evade isolation mechanisms be-
tween multiple parties in the cloud. Especially cache covert
channels allow the transmission of several hundred kilobits
per second between unprivileged user programs in separate
virtual machines. However, caches are small and shared and
thus cache-based communication is susceptible to noise from
any system activity and interrupts. The feasibility of a reliable
cache covert channel under a severe noise scenario has not
been demonstrated yet. Instead, previous work relies on either
of the two contradicting assumptions: the assumption of direct
applicability of error-correcting codes, or the assumption that
noise effectively prevents covert channels.

In this paper, we show that both assumptions are wrong.
First, error-correcting codes cannot be applied directly, due
to the noise characteristics. Second, even with extraordinarily
high system activity, we demonstrate an error-free and high-
throughput covert channel. We provide the ﬁrst comprehensive
characterization of noise on cache covert channels due to cache
activity and interrupts. We build the ﬁrst robust covert channel
based on established techniques from wireless transmission proto-
cols, adapted for our use in microarchitectural attacks. Our error-
correcting and error-handling high-throughput covert channel
can sustain transmission rates of more than 45 KBps on Amazon
EC2, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous covert
channels demonstrated on Amazon EC2. Our robust and error-
free channel even allows us to build an SSH connection between
two virtual machines, where all existing covert channels fail.
