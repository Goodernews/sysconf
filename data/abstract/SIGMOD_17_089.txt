with updates in the underlying dataset—is a difficult topic. This
is especially true for density-based clustering, where objects are
aggregated based on transitivity of proximity, under which deciding
the cluster(s) of an object may require the inspection of numerous
other objects. The phenomenon is unfortunate, given the popular
usage of this clustering approach in many applications demanding
data updates.

Motivated by the above, we investigate the algorithmic principles for dynamic clustering by DBSCAN, a successful representative of density-based clustering, and p-approximate DBSCAN,
proposed to bring down the computational hardness of the former
on static data. Surprisingly, we prove that the p-approximate version suffers from the very same hardness when the dataset is fully
dynamic, namely, when both insertions and deletions are allowed.
We also show that this issue goes away as soon as tiny further relaxation is applied, yet still ensuring the same quality—known as the
“sandwich guarantee”—of p-approximate DBSCAN. Our algorithms
guarantee near-constant update processing, and outperform existing
approaches by a factor over two orders of magnitude.
