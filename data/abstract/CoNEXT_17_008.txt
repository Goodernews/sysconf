that enables devices to utilize multiple network interfaces. The
default MPTCP path scheduler prioritizes paths with the smallest
round trip time (RTT). In this work, we examine whether the default
MPTCP path scheduler can provide applications the ideal aggregate
bandwidth, i.e., the sum of available bandwidths of every paths. Our
experimental results show that heterogeneous paths cause underutilization of the fast path, resulting in undesirable application
behaviors such as lower streaming quality in a video than can be
obtained using the available aggregate bandwidth. To solve this
problem, we propose and implement a new MPTCP path scheduler,
ECF (Earliest Completion First), that utilizes all relevant information
about a path, not just RTT. We compare ECF with both the default
and other MPTCP path schedulers, using both an experimental
testbed and in-the-wild measurements. Our results show that ECF
consistently utilizes all available paths more efficiently than other
approaches under path heterogeneity, particularly for streaming
video. In Web browsing workloads, ECF also does better in some
scenarios and never does worse.
