
Full-system simulators are increasingly finding their
way into the consumer space for the purposes of backwards
compatibility and hardware emulation (e.g. for games consoles).
For such compute-intensive applications simulation performance
is paramount. In this paper we argue that existing benchmark
suites such as SPEC CPU2006, originally designed for architecture and compiler performance evaluation, are not well suited
for the identification of performance bottlenecks in full-system
simulators. While their large, complex workloads provide an
indication as to the performance of the simulator on ‘real-world’
workloads, this does not give any indication of why a particular
simulator might run an application faster or slower than another.
In this paper we present SimBench, an extensive suite of
targeted micro-benchmarks designed to run bare-metal on a fullsystem simulator. SimBench exercises dynamic binary translation
(BT) performance, interrupt and exception handling, memory
access performance, I/O and other performance-sensitive areas.
SimBench is cross-platform benchmarking framework and can
be retargeted to new architectures with minimal effort. For
several simulators, including QEMU, Gem5 and SimIt-ARM, and
targeting ARM and Intel x86 architectures, we demonstrate that
SimBench is capable of accurately pinpointing and explaining
real-world performance anomalies, which are largely obfuscated
by existing application-oriented benchmarks.
