
Datacenters provide flexibility and high performance for
users and cost efficiency for operators. However, the high
computational demands of big data and analytics
technologies such as MapReduce, a dominant programming
model and framework for big data analytics, mean that even
small changes in the efficiency of execution in the data center
can have a large effect on user cost and operational cost.
Fine-tuning configuration parameters of MapReduce
applications at the application, architecture, and system
levels plays a crucial role in improving the energy-efficiency
of the server and reducing the operational cost. In this work,
through methodical investigation of performance and power
measurements, we demonstrate how the interplay among
various MapReduce configurations as well as application
and architecture level parameters create new opportunities
to co-locate MapReduce applications at the node level. We
also show how concurrently fine-tuning optimization
parameters for multiple scheduled MapReduce applications
improves energy-efficiency compared to fine-tuning
parameters for each application separately. In this paper, we
present Co-Located Application Optimization (COLAO)
that co-schedules multiple MapReduce applications at the
node level to enhance energy efficiency. Our results show
that through co-locating MapReduce applications and finetuning configuration parameters concurrently, COLAO
reduces the number of nodes by half to execute MapReduce
applications while improving the EDP by 2.2X on average,
compared to fine-tuning applications individually and run
them serially for a broad range of studied workloads.
