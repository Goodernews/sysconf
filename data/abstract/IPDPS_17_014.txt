
Abstractâ€” Resource management of modern datacenters
needs to consider multiple competing objectives that involve
complex system interactions. In this work, Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL) is adopted in describing such interactions by
leveraging its ability to express complex properties. Further,
LTL-based constraints are integrated with reinforcement learning according the recent progress on control synthesis theory.
The LTL-constrained reinforcement learning facilitates desired
balance among the competing objectives in managing resources
for datacenters. The effectiveness of this new approach is
demonstrated by two scenarios. In datacenter power management, the LTL-constrained manager reaches the best balance
among power, performance and battery stress compared to
the previous work and other alternative approaches. In multitenant job scheduling, 200 MapReduce jobs are emulated on the
Amazon AWS cloud. The LTL-constrained scheduler achieves
the best balance between system performance and fairness
compared to several other methods including three Hadoop
schedulers.
