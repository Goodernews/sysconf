
Provenance describes detailed information about
the history of a piece of data, containing the relationships
among elements such as users, processes, jobs, and workflows
that contribute to the existence of data. Provenance is key
to supporting many data management functionalities that are
increasingly important in operations such as identifying data
sources, parameters, or assumptions behind a given result;
auditing data usage; or understanding details about how inputs
are transformed into outputs. Despite its importance, however,
provenance support is largely underdeveloped in highly parallel
architectures and systems. One major challenge is the demanding
requirements of providing provenance service in situ. The need
to remain lightweight and to be always on often conflicts
with the need to be transparent and offer an accurate catalog
of details regarding the applications and systems. To tackle
this challenge, we introduce a lightweight provenance service,
called LPS, for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. LPS
leverages a kernel instrument mechanism to achieve transparency
and introduces representative execution and flexible granularity to
capture comprehensive provenance with controllable overhead.
Extensive evaluations and use cases have confirmed its efficiency
and usability. We believe that LPS can be integrated into current
and future HPC systems to support a variety of data management
needs.
