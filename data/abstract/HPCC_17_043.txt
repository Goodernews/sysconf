
Memory size and the number of cores inside a chip are increasing
with the advancement of technology. With 3D stacked IC technology,
memory size becomes even larger inside the chip-multiprocessor. So memory
mapping, task scheduling and along with communication optimization
of the network-on-chip become crucial. Hence operating system memory
management and scheduling approach need to consider this advancement
of the on-chip memory size and on-chip network architecture for efficient
mapping.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient virtual page to memory slice
mapping and used simulated annealing based thread to core mapping of
multi-threaded application onto 3D stacked memory chip-multiprocessor.
Our experimental result shows, the thread to core mapping reduces the overall on-chip communication cost up to 26% and an average of 12%. Moreover,
our proposed virtual pages to DRAM slices mapping reduces the overall onchip communication cost up to a maximum of 86% and an average of 56%
for many real multi-threaded benchmarks and multi-benchmark workloads.
Results also show that overall on-chip communication cost does not improve
much due to the thread only mapping, but when it is combined with the
virtual page to DRAM slice mapping then improvements are significant.
Further, we extended the approach to do dynamic virtual page mapping
at runtime, which reduces overall communication cost up to 78% with
incurring a negligible amount of overhead.
