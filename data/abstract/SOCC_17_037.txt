in data centers to offload networking functions (NFs) from host
processors thereby making these processors available for tenant applications. Modern sNICs have fully programmable, energy-efficient
multi-core processors on which many packet processing functions,
including a full-blown programmable switch, can run. However,
having multiple switch instances deployed across the host hypervisor and the attached sNICs makes controlling them difficult and
data plane operations more complex.

This paper proposes a generalized SDN-controlled NF offload
architecture called UNO. It can transparently offload dynamically
selected host processors’ packet processing functions to sNICs by
using multiple switches in the host while keeping the data centerwide network control and management planes unmodified. UNO
exposes a single virtual control plane to the SDN controller and
hides dynamic NF offload behind a unified virtual management
plane. This enables UNO to make optimal use of host’s and sNIC’s
combined packet processing capabilities with local optimization
based on locally observed traffic patterns and resource consumption,
and without central controller involvement. Experimental results
based on areal UNO prototype in realistic scenarios show promising
results: it can save processing worth up to 8 CPU cores, reduce
power usage by up to 2x, and reduce the control plane overhead by
more than 50%.
