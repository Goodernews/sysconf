Internet-of-Things, real-time processing of big data has
become a core operation in various business areas. It is of
paramount importance that big-data analyses are executed
timely with specified accuracy guarantees. However, workloads in the wild are highly bursty with skewed contents
and often present the conundrum of meeting latency and
accuracy requirements simultaneously. In this paper we
propose AccStream, which selectively samples and processes data tuples and blocks on emerging batch streaming
platforms with a special focus on analysis of aggregation,
e.g., counts, and top-k. AccStream dynamically learns the
latency model of analysis jobs via on-line probing technique
and employs sample theory to determine the lower limit of
data so as to fulfill given accuracy targets. A unique feature
of AccStream ensuring strong latency-accuracy fulfillment
even under conflicts is the hybrid windowing that trades off
data freshness via a combination of tumbling and rolling
windows. We evaluate the prototype of AccStream on Spark
Streaming, analyzing Twitter data. Our extensive results
confirm that AccStream is able to achieve the latency and
accuracy target against a wide range of conditions, i.e., slow
and fast dynamic load intensities and content skewnesses,
even when facing conflicting latency and accuracy targets.
All in all, the effectiveness of AccStream in delivering
timely, accurate, and (partial) fresh streaming analytics lies
in shedding the adequate amount of input data at the right
time and place.
