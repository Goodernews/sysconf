
Data access is swiftly becoming a bottleneck in visual
data processing, providing an opportunity to influence
the way visual data is treated in the storage system. To
foster this discussion, we identify two key areas where
storage research can strongly influence visual processing run-times: efficient metadata storage and new storage formats for visual data. We propose a storage architecture designed for efficient visual data access that
exploits next generation hardware and give preliminary
results showing how it enables efficient vision analytics.
