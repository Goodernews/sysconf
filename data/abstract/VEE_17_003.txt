
Live migration of a virtual machine (VM) is a powerful technique with benefits of server maintenance, resource management, dynamic workload re-balance, etc. Modern research
has effectively reduced the VM live migration (VMLM) time
to dozens of milliseconds, but live migration still exhibits
failures if it cannot terminate within the given time constraint. The ability to predict this type of failure can avoid
wasting networking and computing resources on the VM
migration, and the associated system performance degradation caused by wasting these resources. The cost of VM
live migration highly depends on the application workload
of the VM, which may undergo frequent changes. At the
same time, the available system resources for VM migration
can also change substantially and frequently. To account for
these issues, we present a solution called MigVisor, which
can accurately predict the behaviour of VM migration using
working-set model. This can enable system managers to predict the migration cost and enhance the system management
efficacy. The experimental results prove the design suitability and show that the MigVisor has a high prediction accuracy since the average relative error between the predicted
value and the measured value is only 6.2%~9%.
