
. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is a well known method
for efficiently solving partial differential equations. A straightforward
AMR algorithm typically exhibits many synchronization points even
during a single time step, where costly communication often degrades
the performance. This problem will be even more pronounced on future
supercomputers containing billion way parallelism, which will raise the
communication cost further. Re-designing AMR algorithms to avoid synchronization is not a viable solution due to the large code size and complex control structures. We present a nonintrusive asynchronous approach to hiding the effects of communication in an AMR application.
Specifically, our approach reasons about data dependencies automatically using domain knowledge about AMR applications, allowing asynchrony to be discovered with only a modest amount of code modification.
Using this approach, we optimize the synchronous AMR algorithm in the
BoxLib software framework without severely affecting the productivity
of the application programmer. We observe around 27-31% performance
improvement for an advection solver on the Hazel Hen supercomputer
using 12288 cores.
