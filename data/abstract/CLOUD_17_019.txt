
Researches affirm that coflow scheduling/routing
substantially shortens the average application inner communication time in data center networks(DCNs). The commonly
desirable critical features of existing coflow scheduling/routing
framework includes (1) coflow scheduling, (2) coflow routing,
and (3) per-flow rate-limiting. However, to provide the 3 features,
existing frameworks require customized computing frameworks,
customized operating systems, or specific external commercial
monitoring frameworks on software-defined networking(SDN)
switches. These requirements defer or even prohibit the deployment of coflow scheduling/routing in production DCNs. In this
paper, we design a coflow scheduling and routing framework,
MinCOF which has minimal requirements on hosts and switches
for cloud storage area networks(SANs) based on OpenFlow SDN.
MinCOF accommodates all critical features of coflow scheduling/routing from previous works. The deployability in production
environment is especially taken into consideration. The OpenFlow architecture is capable of processing the traffic load in a
cloud SAN. Not necessary requirements for hosts from existing
frameworks are migrated to the mature commodity OpenFlow
1.3 Switch and our coflow scheduler. Transfer applications on
hosts only need slight enhancements on their existing connection
establishment and progress reporting functions. Evaluations reveal that MinCOF decreases the average coflow completion time
(CCT) by 12.94% compared to the latest OpenFlow-based coflow
scheduling and routing framework.
