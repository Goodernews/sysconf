
We consider the distributed setting of N autonomous mobile robots that operate in Look-Compute-Move
(LCM) cycles and communicate with other robots using colored
lights (the robots with lights model). We study the fundamental
problem of repositioning NV autonomous robots on a plane
so that each robot is visible to all others (the COMPLETE
VISIBILITY problem) on this model; a robot cannot see another
robot if a third robot is positioned between them on the straight
line connecting them. There exists an O(1) time, O(1) color
algorithm for this problem in the semi-synchronous setting.
In this paper, we provide the first O(log NV) time, O(1) color
algorithm for this problem in the asynchronous setting. This
is a significant improvement over an O(V)-time translation of
the semi-synchronous algorithm to the asynchronous setting.
The proposed algorithm is collision-free â€” robots do not share
positions and their paths do not cross.
