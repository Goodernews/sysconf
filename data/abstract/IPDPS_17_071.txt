
Designing a cost-effective network for data centers
that can deliver sufficient bandwidth and provide high availability
has drawn tremendous attentions recently. In this paper, we
propose a novel server-centric network structure called RCube,
which is energy efficient and can deploy a redundancy scheme
to improve the availability of data centers. Moreover, RCube
shares many good properties with BCube, a well known servercentric network structure, yet its network size can be adjusted
more conveniently. We also present a routing algorithm to find
paths in RCube and an algorithm to build multiple parallel paths
between any pair of source and destination servers. In addition,
we theoretically analyze the power efficiency of the network and
availability of RCube under server failure. Our comprehensive
simulations demonstrate that RCube provides higher availability
and flexibility to make trade-off among many factors, such as
power consumption and aggregate throughput, than BCube, while
delivering similar performance to BCube in many critical metrics,
such as average path length, path distribution and graceful
degradation, which makes RCube a very promising empirical
structure for an enterprise data center network product.
