
Communication-avoiding algorithms have been a subject of growing interest in the last decade due to the growth of distributed
memory systems and the disproportionate increase of computational throughput to communication bandwidth. For distributed
1D FFTs, communication costs quickly dominate execution time
as all industry-standard implementations perform three all-to-all
transpositions of the data. In this work, we reformulate an existing
algorithm that employs the Fast Multipole Method to reduce the
communication requirements to approximately a single all-to-all
transpose. We present a detailed and clear implementation strategy
that relies heavily on existing library primitives, demonstrate that
our strategy achieves consistent speed-ups between 1.3x and 2.2x
against cuFFTXT on up to eight NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs, and
develop an accurate compute model to analyze the performance
and dependencies of the algorithm.
