and power efficiency by integrating massively parallel hardware accelerators (coprocessors) into compute systems. Many
modern HPC clusters now consist of multi-CPU nodes along
with additional hardware accelerators in the form of graphics
processing units (GPUs). Each CPU and GPU is integrated
with system memory via communication links (QPI and
PCIe) and multi-channel memory controllers. The increasing density of these heterogeneous computing systems has
resulted in complex performance phenomena including nonuniform memory access (NUMA) and resource contention
that make application performance hard to predict and tune.
This paper presents the Topology Aware Resource Usability
and Contention (TARUC) benchmark. TARUC is a modular, open-source, and highly configurable benchmark useful
for profiling dense heterogeneous systems to provide insight
for developers who wish to tune application codes for specific systems. Analysis of TARUC performance profiles from
a multi-CPU, multi-GPU system is also presented.
