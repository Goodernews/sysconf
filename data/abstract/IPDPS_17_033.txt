
In the reliable message transmission problem
(RMTP) processors communicate by exchanging messages, but
the channel that connects two processors is subject to message
loss, duplication, and reordering. Previous work focused on
proposing protocols in asynchronous systems, where message
size is finite and sequence numbers are bounded. However,
if the channel can duplicate messages—but not lose them-—and
arbitrarily reorder the messages, the problem is unsolvable.
We consider a strengthening of the asynchronous model in
which reordering of messages is bounded. In this model, we
develop an efficient protocol to solve the RMTP when messages
may be duplicated but not lost. This result is in contrast
to the impossibility of such an algorithm when reordering
is unbounded. Our protocol has the pleasing property that
no messages need to be sent from the receiver to the sender
and it works when message loss is allowed with some minimal
modifications.
