
In high-performance computing (HPC), end-to-end
workflows are typically utilized to gain insights from scientific
simulations. An end-to-end workflow consists of scientific simulation and data analysis, and can be executed in-situ, in-transit,
and offline. Existing studies on end-to-end workflows have largely
focused on the high-performance execution approaches. However,
the emerging heterogeneous architectures and energy concerns
lead to the rethinking of workflow execution approaches. As
a guide to the rethinking, this paper evaluates how to run
end-to-end HPC workflows efficiently in terms of performance,
energy, and error resilience. The evaluation covers emerging
heterogeneous processor architectures, processor power capping
techniques, and heterogeneous-reliability memory.
