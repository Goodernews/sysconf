
General purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing in virtualized
environments leverages PCI passthrough to achieve GPU
performance comparable to bare-metal execution. However,
GPU passthrough prevents service administrators from performing virtual machine migration between physical hosts.

Crane is a new technique for virtualizing OpenCL-based
GPGPU computing that achieves within 5.25% of passthrough GPU performance while supporting VM migration. Crane interposes a virtualization-aware OpenCL library that makes it possible to reclaim and subsequently
reassign physical GPUs to a VM without terminating the
guest or its applications. Crane also enables continued GPU
operation while the VM is undergoing live migration by
transparently switching between GPU passthrough operation and API remoting.
