
With DevOps automation and an everything-as-code approach to lifecycle management for cloud-native applications, challenges emerge from an operational visibility and
control perspective. Once a VM is deployed in production it
typically becomes a hands-off entity in terms of restrictions
towards inspecting or tuning it, for the fear of negatively
impacting its operation. We present CIVIC (Cloning and
Injection based VM Inspection for Cloud), a new mechanism that enables safe inspection of unmodified production
VMs on-the-fly. CIVIC restricts all impact and side-effects
of inspection or analysis operations inside a live clone of
the production VM. New functionality over the replicated
VM state is introduced using code injection. In this paper,
we describe the design and implementation of our solution
over KVM/QEMU. We demonstrate four of its use-cases(i) safe reuse of system monitoring agents, (ii) impact-heavy
problem diagnostics and troubleshooting, (iii) attaching an
intrusive anomaly detector to a live service, and (iv) live
tuning of a webserverâ€™s configuration parameters. Our evaluation shows CIVIC is nimble and lightweight in terms of
memory footprint as well as clone activation time (6.5s),
and has a low impact on the original VM (< 10%).
