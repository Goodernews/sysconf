and then check whether R is an equivalence relation, R enforces the
policy Φ, |R| = N , α ⊆ R, and accept only if all of these conditions
are met, which can be checked in polynomial time.
We now show that the functional problem is in FPNP by providing a polynomial algorithm with an oracle for the decision problem:
(1) We determine the maximum possible size of an equivalence relation enforcing Φ. We use binary search on the
interval [0, |O|]. To determine if an equivalence relation
of size k exists, we query the oracle with an instance
(I, O, δ, π , Φ, k, ∅). Let the maximum size be K.
(2) We find an equivalence relation of size K enforcing the
policy Φ. To do this, we initialize ξ ← ∅ and ξˆ ← O × O
and iterate the following procedure until ξˆ , ∅:
(a) Pick an arbitrary element (o, o ′ ) from ξˆ. Query the
oracle with (I, O, δ, π , Φ, K, ξ ∪ {(o, o ′ )})
(b) If the answer is Yes, then ξ ← ξ ∪ {(o, o ′ )}. If the
answer is No, do nothing.
(c) ξˆ ← ξˆ \ {(o, o ′ )}
(d) Iterate until ξˆ , ∅.
After the iteration ends, we just output ξ .
