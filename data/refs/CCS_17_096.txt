extension/truncation attacks in absence of any authentication.
• The standard is vague in its specification of the license response
protocol. There are different security sensitive parameters like
the length field, the command byte, the license id, etc, that are
exchanged between the proxy server and the tool in each of
their messages. Hence, it is crucial to clearly state how each of
these parameters is checked/handled by the tool. However, the
standard (again) leaves these security sensitive decisions at the
discretion of the tool vendors.
