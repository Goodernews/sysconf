tag,description
"system","Reports design, implementation, or performance of a newly engineered system."
"positive","Reports new positive results (improvement over past work)."
"negative","Reports new negative results or failure to reproduce past results. Examples include a system that doesn't yield the expected results, or workloads under which the proposed system performs worse than before."
"experience","Focuses on a new experience with a (possibly extant) system. Most systems papers describe experiences, but this tag is assigned only to papers where the experience is described in detail and consists of a top contribution for the paper."
"data","Exposes or analyzes a dataset that hadn't been previously discussed."
"survey","Relies primarily on reviewing, or summarizing, previous work (literature or software)."
"position","Promotes opinions, optionally backed by new evidence. Positions represent suggestions or point of view that may be argued even based on the same data."
"reproduction","Attempts to reproduce or debunk a previous result. A mere comparison to past results or systems does not constitute a reproduction."
"open","Releases code or data openly set as part of the publication."
"experiment","Reports results that were obtained from measuring a representative hardware or software system. An experimental result includes all hidden assumptions as well (as distinguished from a simulation, wherein all assumptions are coded)."
"simulation","Reports results that were obtained from simulating or emulating a system, for examle using a hardware simulator or a workload generator."
"analysis","Reports results that were derived analytically, possibly with proofs."
"preliminary","Describes a system or idea that isn't fully completed or evaluated yet."
"continuing","Describes a system (by the same authors) previously described in another paper."
"bigscale","Describes experience on experiment on a uniquely large-scale system or software, one not easily reproducible by other research groups."
