CLOUD 2017 Call for Papers

Sponsored by the Technical Committee on Services Computing (TC-SVC), IEEE Computer Society
The 10th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2017)

Theme: Cloud Services
CLOUD 2017 organizing committee invites you to participate in the 10th edition of CLOUD, to be held on June 25 - June 30, 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA
CLOUD 2017 has obtained approval from the following journals to organize special issues based on extended versions of top CLOUD papers:
-One Special Issue in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC) (Indexed by SCI & EI), 
-Four Special Issues in International Journal of Cloud Computing (IJCC), 
-One Special Issue in International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR)(Indexed by SCI & EI), 
-One Special Issue in International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM).
Selected accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions to special issues of TSC, IJCC, JWSR, and IJBPIM.
The IEEE International Conference on Web Services (CLOUD) has been a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of cloud computing, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of cloud computing.
Cloud Computing has become a scalable services consumption and delivery platform in the field of Services Computing. The technical foundations of Cloud Computing include Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Virtualizations of hardware and software. The goal of Cloud Computing is to share resources among the cloud service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value chain. The resource sharing at various levels results in various cloud offerings such as infrastructure cloud (e.g., hardware, IT infrastructure management), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware as a service, or traditional CRM as a service), application cloud (e.g., Application as a Service, UML modeling tools as a service, social network as a service), and business cloud (e.g., business process as a service).
In 2017, CLOUD 2017 will co-locate with the following service-oriented sister conferences: the 24th IEEE 2017 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2017), the 14th IEEE 2017 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2017), the 6th IEEE International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2017), the 6th International Congress on Big Data BigData Congress(BigData Congress 2017), and 2017 IEEE World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2017)	The six co-located theme topic conferences will all center around "services," while each focusing on exploring different aspects (cloud-based services, web-based services, business services, mobile services, Big Data-based services, and industry-specific services and emerging service-oriented technologies). CLOUD 2017 will grow itself to continue to be the most prestigious professional conference dedicated to cloud computing.
The technical program of CLOUD 2017 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The CLOUD 2017 tracks seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of cloud services. Research Track papers MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of Web-based services. All papers MUST properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of CLOUD, SCC, CLOUD, SERVICES, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including TSC, JWSR, IJSC, and IJBPIM (see Literature Recommendations page).
Contributions addressing all areas related to cloud computing technology, systems, applications and business innovations are solicited. CLOUD 2017 will organize refereed paper reviews in 10 research areas (themes):

All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted and presented papers from all CLOUD tracks will appear in the conference proceedings (SCI & EI indexed) published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Extended versions of research track papers and selected application track papers will be invited for potential publication in the IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC), International Journal of Cloud Computing, and International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM). Both TSC and JWSR are indexed by SCI and EI [Link].
Submitted Research Track and Application Track manuscripts will be limited to 8 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the IEEE Proceedings template. Submitted Short Paper track manuscripts will be limited to 4 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit may not be reviewed. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required. Detailed instructions for electronic paper preparation and submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, workshop proposals, and review process can be found at Conference website.
At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register to the conference and present the paper. One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be granted at CLOUD 2017. The first author of the best student paper must be a full-time student.
Manuscripts submitted to the Research Track focusing on application or solution descriptions may be recommended to the Application Track or other tracks for further consideration if the session slots are available.

Review Policy 
IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice. 

Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at an IEEE conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.
