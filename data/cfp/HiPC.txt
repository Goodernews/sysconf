HiPC 2017 Call For Papers
HiPC 2017 will be the 24th edition of the IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics. HiPC serves as a forum to present current work by researchers from around the world as well as highlight activities in Asia in the area high performance computing. The meeting focuses on all aspects of high performance computing systems and their scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. In 2016, to keep pace with new computing trends, the conference added two new areas of interest to its name, Data and Analytics, as reflected in the list below.
 
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished research manuscripts that demonstrate current research in all areas of high performance computing, data and analytics. Topics include (but are not limited to): 
 
Algorithms: 
Design and Application of Parallel and Distributed Big Data and Analytics Algorithms
Algorithmic Techniques to Improve Energy and Power Efficiency 
Quantum and Bio-Inspired Algorithms
Resilient and Fault Tolerant Algorithms 
Parallel algorithms for Numerical Linear Algebra
Concurrent Algorithms and Data Structures
Load Balancing, Scheduling and Resource Management

Manuscript Guidelines
Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5×11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. See style templates for details:
LaTex Package (ZIP)
Word Package (ZIP)
 
Electronic submissions must be in the form of a readable PDF file. Manuscripts must be received by June 30, 2017. All manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee and evaluated on originality, relevance of the problem to the conference theme, technical strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, and organization and clarity of presentation of the paper. 
 
Authors are highly encouraged to list the key contributions of their paper. This should be in a separate paragraph in the introduction to the paper. Please note that the review process is “single-blind” (i.e., authors can list their names on the paper), and that there will be a rebuttal period from August 8 to August 15, 2017. 
 
Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the Program Chair at the email address below for further information or clarification. Notification of review decisions will be emailed by September 8, 2017. Camera-ready papers are due by October 3, 2017. A published proceedings will be available at the conference.
 
At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.
 
Authors of selected high quality papers in HiPC 2017 will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers for possible publication in a special issue of Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing.
