Cloud, grid, search engines, e-commerce, web, databases, file/application servers
Embedded, real-time, Edge Computing, mobile and extensible distributed systems, multimedia
Memory, storage, and file systems
Life sciences, bioinformatics, scientific computing, finance, forecasting
Management and/or analytics big data, machine Learning, Analytics, Data mining and other data-intensive computation
Security, reliability, biometrics
User behavior and system-user interaction, social computing
Cyber-physical systems, pervasive computation and Internet of Things (IoT)

Characterization of workload on emerging technology, such as
Quantum computation and communication
Near-threshold Computation
Non-volatile memory

Characterization of OS, Virtual Machine, middleware and library behavior
Virtual machines, Websphere, .NET, Java VM, databases
Graphics libraries, scientific libraries
Operating system and hypervisor effects and overheads

Implications of workloads in design issues, such as
Reliability, performance, power, security and privacy, scalability, and sustainability
Processors, memory hierarchy, I/O, and networks
Performance accelerators, FPGA’s, GPU’s, etc.
Near data processing architectures
Novel architectures (non-Von-Neumann)

Benchmark creation and evaluation, including
Multithreaded benchmarks, benchmark cloning
Profiling, trace collection, synthetic traces
Validation of benchmarks

Measurement tools and techniques, including
