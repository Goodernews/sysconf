The IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS) provides a forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial research work focused on performance analysis in the design of computer systems and software. In 2017, ISPASS will be held April 23 through 25, 2017 in California's wine country (San Francisco Bay Area). Authors are invited to submit previously unpublished work for possible presentation at the conference. Papers are solicited in fields that include the following:

Performance and power evaluation methodologies
Analytical modeling
Statistical approaches
Tracing and profiling tools
Simulation techniques
Hardware (e.g., FPGA) accelerated simulation
Hardware performance counter architectures
Power/Temperature/Variability/Reliability models for computer systems
Microbenchmark-based hardware analysis techniques
Performance and power analysis
Metrics
Bottleneck identification and analysis
Visualization
Power/Performance analysis of commercial and experimental hardware
General-purpose microprocessors
Multi-threaded, multicore and many-core architectures
Accelerators and graphics processing units
Embedded and mobile systems
Enterprise systems and data centers
Supercomputers
Computer networks
Power/Performance analysis of emerging workloads and software
Software written in managed languages
Virtualization and consolidation workloads
Internet-sector workloads
Embedded, multimedia, games, telepresence
Bioinformatics, life sciences, security, biometrics
Deep learning and convolutional neural networks
Application and system code tuning and optimization
Confirmations or refutations of important prior results
In addition to research papers, we also welcome tool and benchmark papers. The conference is an ideal forum to publicize new tools and benchmarks to the community. These papers, which can detail tools and benchmarks in any of the above fields of interest, will be judged primarily on their potential impact and use, rather than on their research contribution.
