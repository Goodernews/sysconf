IPDPS 2017 Call For Papers
31st IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium 
May 29 – June 2, 2017 
Orlando, Florida USA

PLEASE NOTE:

Authors must register their paper and submit an abstract by October 18, 2016.  
Authors must then submit full versions of registered papers by October 23, 2016.
All deadlines are end of day ANYWHERE ON EARTH.
Before submitting, review the information under WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT below.
SUBMIT YOUR PAPER http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2012/2012_phd_forum_clip_image001.png
SCOPE: 
Authors are invited to submit manuscripts that present original unpublished research in all areas of parallel and distributed processing, including the development of experimental or commercial systems. Work focusing on emerging technologies and interdisciplinary work covering multiple IPDPS areas are especially welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Parallel and distributed algorithms, focusing on topics such as: numerical and combinatorial parallel algorithms for analysis, machine learning and simulation; parallel algorithms for accelerators, neuromorphic architectures, and other non-traditional systems; algorithms for cloud computing; power-aware parallel algorithms; streaming algorithms; domain-specific parallel and distributed algorithms; performance modeling and analysis of parallel and distributed algorithms; run-time algorithms and protocols for resource management, communication and synchronization on parallel and distributed systems.
Applications of parallel and distributed computing, including computational and data-enabled science and engineering, big data applications, parallel crowd sourcing, large-scale social network analysis, management of big data, cloud and grid computing, scientific, biological and medical applications, and mobile computing. Papers focusing on applications using novel commercial or research architectures, big data approaches, or discussing scalability toward the exascale level are encouraged.
Parallel and distributed architectures, including architectures for instruction-level and thread-level parallelism; memory technologies and memory hierarchy architectures; exascale systems designs; data center architectures; novel big data architectures; special purpose architectures, including graphics processors, signal processors, network processors, media accelerators, neuromorphic systems, and other special purpose processors and accelerators; impact of technology on architecture; network and interconnect architectures; parallel I/O and storage systems; power-efficient and green computing systems; resilience and dependable architectures; and performance modeling and evaluation.
Parallel and distributed software, including parallel and multicore programming languages and compilers, runtime systems, operating systems, resource management including, middleware for supercomputers, grids, clouds, and data centers, libraries, performance modeling and evaluation, parallel programming paradigms, and programming environments and tools. Papers focusing on novel software systems for big data and exascale systems are encouraged.
Papers that cross the boundaries of the four traditional tracks of IPDPS (Algorithms, Applications, Architecture and Software) are encouraged and can be submitted to a newly established multidisciplinary track. During submission of multidisciplinary papers, authors should indicate their subject areas that can come from any track.

BEST PAPERS AWARDS: 
The program committee will nominate papers for recognition in several categories including the four conference topic areas as well as best multidisciplinary paper and will consider other paper attributes that merit recognition from the conference. The five top best papers will be selected for presentation and the others will receive honorable mention in the conference program.

WHAT/WHERE TO SUBMIT: 
Abstracts must be submitted by October 18th; submitted abstracts may not exceed 500 words. Manuscripts must be submitted by October 23rd; submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The submitted manuscripts should include author names and affiliations. See style templates for details:

LaTex Package (ZIP)
Word Template (ZIP)
Files should be submitted by following the instructions at the EasyChair portal.  Click here to submit your abstract and register your paper by October 18th. 

REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS: 
All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted papers should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop or journal.

Questions may be sent to PC2017@ipdps.org. Abstracts are due October 18, 2016 and full manuscripts must be received by October 23, 2016. This is a final, hard deadline; to ensure fairness, no extensions will be given. There will be a one week review feedback and author response period from November 28th to December 5th. Notification of final decisions will be mailed by January 8, 2017, and camera-ready papers will be due February 15, 2017.
