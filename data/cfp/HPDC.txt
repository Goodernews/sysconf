Overview
The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and the use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end computing. The 26th HPDC will take place in Washington DC on June 26-30, 2017.

Scope and Topics
Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing (HPDC) topics including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Submissions that focus on the operating systems, runtime environments, architectures, and networks of high end computing systems are particularly encouraged. Experience reports of operational deployments that provide significantly novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems will also receive special consideration. All papers will be evaluated for their originality, technical depth and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate research contributions and novelty, while experience reports must clearly describe lessons learned and demonstrate impact.

In the context of high-performance parallel and distributed computing, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Operating systems, networks, and architectures
High performance runtime environments
Massively multicore systems, including heterogeneous systems
Datacenter technology, resource virtualization
Programming languages, APIs, and system interoperation approaches
File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
Big data stacks and big data ecosystems
Resource management and scheduling, including energy-aware techniques
Performance modeling, analysis, and engineering
Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability
Operational guarantees, and risk assessment and management
Traditional and emerging applications and services that depend upon high- end computing
PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Note: The review process is not double-blinded; the authors can reveal their identities in the paper (It's also OK to conceal them if they so wish).

Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 12 pages in PDF format, including figures and references. Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style and submitted via the conference web site. Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and will be incorporated into the ACM Digital Library. Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.
Submissions
Please submit your paper here when ready (open as of 11/30/16).
