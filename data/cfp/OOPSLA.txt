Call for Papers
New this year
Those familiar with previous OOPSLA conferences should be aware that this year, papers selected for OOPSLA 2017 will be published as the OOPSLA 2017 issue of a new journal, Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL), which replaces the previous OOPSLA conference proceedings. The move to PACMPL will have two noticeable impacts on authors:

PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, so all OOPSLA papers will be freely available to the public. PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently 400 USD), but payment is not required or expected for publication. Authors are encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY) license, which grants readers liberal (re-)use rights.

Submitted papers will use PACMPL’s new, single-column format, described in the Instructions for Authors.

Paper Selection Criteria
The program committee will consider the following criteria when evaluating submitted papers:

Novelty: The paper presents new ideas and/or results and places these ideas and results appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field.

Importance: The paper contributes significantly to the advancement of knowledge in the field. In addition to more traditional contributions, OOPSLA welcomes papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.

Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.

Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.

Review Process
This section outlines the two-stage process with lightweight double-blind reviewing that will be used to select papers for presentation at OOPSLA 2017. A list of frequently asked questions and answers that address common concerns is available and will be updated as necessary to clarify and expand on this process.

OOPSLA 2017 will employ a two-stage review process. The first stage in the review process will assess submitted papers using the criteria stated above and will allow for feedback and input on initial reviews through the author response period discussed in the Instructions for Authors. At the PC meeting, a set of papers will be conditionally accepted and all other papers will be rejected. Authors will be notified of these decisions on June 21, 2017.

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions. After five weeks (July 27, 2017), the authors will provide a second submission. The second and final reviewing phase assesses whether the mandatory revisions have been adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final accept/reject status of the paper. The intent and expectation is that the mandatory revisions can be addressed within five weeks and hence that conditionally accepted papers will in general be accepted in the second phase.

The second submission should clearly identify how the mandatory revisions were addressed. To that end, the second submission must be accompanied by a cover letter mapping each mandatory revision request to specific parts of the paper. The cover letter will facilitate a quick second review, allowing for confirmation of final acceptance within two weeks. Conversely, the absence of a cover letter will be grounds for the paper’s rejection.

OOPSLA 2017 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

author names and institutions must be omitted, and
references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).
The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

Submission Requirements
Details on formatting and other submission requirements can be found in the Instructions for Authors. In addition to the requirements for double-blind submission, submissions must conform to both the ACM Policies for Authorship and SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a license or copyright release.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Artifact Evaluation
Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase of the review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. These items will then be reviewed by a committee, separate from the program committee, whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the associated paper. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to make the supporting materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, for example, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library. An additional seal will mark papers whose artifacts are made available, as outlined in the ACM guidelines for artifact badging.

Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding paper acceptance.
