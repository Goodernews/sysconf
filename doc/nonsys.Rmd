## Distribution comparison
Compare distributions to the two non-system areas on all preceding chapters.

Overlay all six metrics (at a time) on a distribution plot of the system conference (including mean, median, and stddev span). How they fall on the curve? (the overall distribution is weighted by no. of papers in conf?)
