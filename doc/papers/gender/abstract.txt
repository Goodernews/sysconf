Methodology...

The data suggests that female participation rate in computer systems research hovers around 11%, about half of the rest of computer science. We discuss possible explanations for this gap and suggest that systems' proximity to engineering disciplines might be the strongest one. We also found that female authors are not only severely under-represented compared to men,  but are even significantly under-represented compared to women in other conference roles. Paradoxically, the explanation for this gap may stem from diversity efforts that boost participation in unreviewed roles.
